are not obliged to enquire into any of these matters; 
 
(c) 
agree we may assume the authenticity of any Instructions given or 
purportedly given by you or any Authorised Person from your Enabled 
Device, are in fact your Instructions. We are not obliged to enquire into 
any of these matters; 
 
(d) 
authorise us to act upon any Instruction that we believe to be authentic 
and valid. We may conclusively rely on the Instructions if we believe that

duly authorised, accurate and complete, even though this is incorrect 
and even if you send us further communications that differ in any respect 
from such Instructions; and 
 
(e) 
are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
Instructions. You acknowledge and agree that once given, an Instruction 
cannot be revoked and if acted on by us, the Instruction will be binding 
on you.

25 
 
to cancel or amend an unexecuted or partly executed Instruction for any 
reason. 
 
(d) 
We use our reasonable endeavours to execute the Instructions, but we 
do not guarantee that the Instructions will be wholly or partially executed 
or will be executed by a certain time. Partially exercised Instructions 
may not be cancelled or reversed on the basis that the Instructions have 
not been wholly exercised. We are not responsible for any delays due to 
a Force Majeure Event, a Network Event, market factors, our own

nor for executing an Order before processing any cancellation or 
amendment that you may send to us.

7 
Payments, deliveries and other obligations 
7.1 
Payment and deliveries 
(a) 
We may, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, 
refuse to accept or make (or accept or make on such terms as it may 
determine) any transfer of a Virtual Asset from or to you and we will 
provide notice of any such refusal as soon as reasonably practicable. In 
27 
 
particular, we may refuse to facilitate any transfer of Virtual Assets, 
whether through the Trade Engine or otherwise, that are not Eligible 
Virtual Assets from you, and you cannot use any such Virtual Assets to 
settle an Executed Order. 
 
(b) 
You acknowledge and agree that if at any time there are (having regard 
to other payments debited or due to be debited) insufficient Eligible 
Virtual Assets recorded in a relevant Account or any amount owed to us, 
we may, in our absolute discretion and without any obligation to do so: 
 
(i) 
decline to execute your Instructions; and 
 
(ii) 
force-sell any Eligible Virtual Assets held by us on your behalf, 
in each case without further instruction or sanction from you. 
7.2 
Withholding 
(a) 
If any Applicable Law requires you to deduct any Tax from a payment to 
us, you must increase the amount payable so that, after making the 
deduction, we receive the amount we would have received if no 
deduction had been required. You agree to deduct the amount for the 
Tax, pay that amount to the relevant Government Agency in accordance 
with Applicable Law and give us the original receipts. 
 
(b) 
We may be required to withhold payments to you, and pass such 
amounts to a Government Agency. If at any time any relevant 
Government Agency requires us to make a deduction or withholding on 
any payment due to you, you agree to immediately reimburse us for the 
amount of any such deduction or withholding or we may recover such 
amount in accordance with clause 7.1(b) (ii). You will indemnify us 
against any Loss we suffer or incur as a result of such deduction or 
withholding. 
 
7.3 
Value added tax 
(a) 
All payments to be made by you in connection with the Agreement are 
calculated without regard to any goods and services tax, consumption 
tax, value added tax or any Tax of a similar nature. 
 
(b) 
If any of these types of Taxes are payable in connection with the 
payment, you must pay us an additional amount equal to the payment 
multiplied by the appropriate rate of Tax. You must do so at the same 
time as making the payment. 
 
7.4 
Independent payment obligations 
Your obligation to pay any amount under the Agreement is separate from each of 
your other obligations to pay. 
 
7.5 
Rights of netting, set-off and lien 
(a) 
If, on any day, either or you or Crypto.com have payment and delivery 
obligations in the same Virtual Asset in respect of two or more Executed 
Orders, then we may elect for such Virtual Asset to be delivered, on a 
net basis so that such obligations will be automatically satisfied and 
discharged.  
(b) 
If, in respect of the same Virtual Asset, the aggregate amount that would 
otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate 
amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, such 
payment and delivery obligations will be replaced by an obligation upon 
the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been 
payable, to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate 
amount over the smaller aggregate amount. 
28 
 
(c) 
In addition to our rights under clause 7.5(a), we may at any time and 
without notice to you set off any amount we owe you against any amount 
that you owe us or, where more than one person constitutes our client, 
that any one or more of those persons singly or jointly owe us (in either 
case, whether or not the obligation is matured or contingent and 
irrespective of the currency, asset or place of payment). Any amounts 
that are so set off will be discharged promptly and in all respects. 
 
(d) 
We are entitled to exercise a lien over any or all of your property which 
(for any reason) is in or comes into our possession or control, except that 
this lien does not cover any property where it may give rise to any 
obligation to disclose an interest on our part. We have the right to sell 
such property and apply the proceeds of sale, after deduction of 
reasonable Costs, to satisfy any amount you owe us. 
 
(e) 
For the purposes of this clause 7.5, we may make any conversion at a 
rate that we reasonably consider appropriate. 
 
(f) 
Our rights under this clause 7.5 are in addition to any other right of set- 
off, offset, combination of accounts, lien, right of retention or withholding 
or similar right or requirement to which we are at any time otherwise 
entitled or subject whether under the Agreement or by operation of 
Applicable Law. 
 
7.6 
Payment in other asset 
You waive any right you may have in any jurisdiction to pay any amount other 
than in the Eligible Virtual Asset in which it is due. If we receive an amount in a 
Virtual Asset other than that in which it is due: 
 
(a) 
we may return the payment and require you to make the payment in the 
appropriate and due Eligible Virtual Asset. We may charge you for the 
Costs incurred in returning the payment to you; or 
 
(b) 
we may convert the amount into the due Eligible Virtual Asset on the 
date and at rates we reasonably consider appropriate. We may deduct 
Costs incurred in the conversion. In such circumstances, you must 
satisfy your obligations to pay in the due Eligible Virtual Asset only to the 
extent of the amount of the due Eligible Virtual Asset or other asset 
obtained from the conversion after deducting the Costs of the 
conversion. 
 
7.7 
Virtual Asset restrictions 
(a) 
You must comply with any exchange controls and Applicable Law in 
connection with the Agreement. 
 
(b) 
If a jurisdiction restricts the availability or transfer of any Virtual Asset, or 
we are otherwise unable to pay in a particular Virtual Asset, we need not 
make any payment to you in that Virtual Asset. We may make the 
payment in any Virtual Asset we reasonably consider appropriate, using 
a rate that we reasonably consider appropriate. 
 
7.8 
Conversion on judgment debt 
If a judgment, order or proof of debt for or the recovery of an amount in 
connection with the Agreement is expressed in a Virtual Asset other than that in 
which the amount is due under the Agreement, then you agree to indemnify us 
on demand against: 
 
(a) 
any difference arising from converting the Virtual Asset, if the rate of 
exchange we would otherwise use under the Agreement when we 
29 
 
receive a payment in the Virtual Asset is less favourable to us than the 
rate of exchange used for the purpose of the judgment, order or 
acceptance of proof of debt; and 
 
(b) 
the Costs of conversion. 
 
7.9 
Third party payments 
We are not obliged to make any payments and or deliveries to a third party, 
except as expressly contemplated by the Agreement or otherwise agreed by us 
in writing. Any third-party payments may also be subject to conditions. 
 
7.10 
General conditions precedent to payments by us 
Each of our obligations to make a payment or delivery, or to perform an 
obligation referred to in this clause 7.10, is subject to the conditions precedent 
that: 
 
(a) 
we are satisfied that you have fulfilled your corresponding obligations (if 
any) in accordance with all applicable terms; 
 
(b) 
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and 
 
(c) 
such actions will not cause us to be in breach of any Applicable Law or 
our internal policies. 
 
7.11 
Return of Virtual Assets 
(a) 
We may, at our discretion, upon the passage of an applicable time 
period determined by us or as otherwise required by Applicable Law or 
our internal policy, return any Virtual Assets recorded in your Account to 
a designated external address that is compatible with the relevant Virtual 
Asset and that is under your control, as last notified to us in writing. 
 
(b) 
If we receive Virtual Assets which are determined not to be Eligible 
Virtual Assets, upon our request, you must provide us with an external 
address under your control. Subject to Applicable Law and our internal 
policy, we will return the Virtual Assets received to such address. 
 
(c) 
To the extent permissible under Applicable Law, we reserve the right to 
deduct a fee, Costs or other administrative charge in respect of the 
return of any Virtual Assets.

If, in our opinion, any event or circumstance, including any Network 
Event or Force Majeure Event, occurs that adversely affects our ability in 
determining the amount payable to or by you in respect of any Order and 
such circumstances continue for a period of not less than five Business 
Days, we may make such adjustments to the method used or to be used 
to determine the amount payable to or by you in respect of any Executed

Adjustments made in accordance with clause 8.2(a) are binding and 
conclusive against you.

Netting and set-off 
9.1 
Netting 
In respect of two or more Executed Orders to which you are a party, a net 
amount will be calculated by us as calculation agent in respect of all amounts 
payable on the same date in the same Virtual Asset in respect of such Executed 
Orders, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same 
Executed Order. 
 
9.2 
Set-off 
At any time, if there are amounts payable in any Virtual Asset by you to us or to 
any counterparty, as calculated by us as calculation agent, then your obligation 
under the Agreement to make payment of any such amount of Virtual Asset will,

satisfied and discharged, in whole or in part, by way of set-off against any Virtual 
Asset in your Account.

(b) 
any Infrastructure Participant or Network Participant becomes Insolvent 
or is suspended from operating; or 
 
(c) 
a Network Event has occurred, 
50 
 
then we may take any action which we, in our sole discretion, consider 
appropriate to correspond with the direction, decision, election or event (including 
a Network Event), or to mitigate any loss incurred or potential loss or impact 
which may be incurred as a result of such action or event. Any such action may 
result in suspension of access to, or adjustment of the balance in, your Account. 
Subject to Applicable Law, any such action will be binding on you (including, 
where relevant, making any decision or election in relation to a Network Event).

in the event of a Network Event which results in loss of ownership or 
control of Virtual Assets, how such loss is apportioned; and

the Agreement in a way that would otherwise have the effect of making a 
provision of the Agreement illegal, void or unenforceable, or contravene 
a requirement of Applicable Law or impose an obligation or liability which 
is prohibited by that law, then the Applicable Law overrides the

to you, you cannot rely on it. You cannot sue us, the valuer or consultant if the

part of it.

Any present or future legislation which operates to vary the obligations of a party 
in connection with the Agreement with the result that another party’s rights,

postponement) is excluded except to the extent that its exclusion is prohibited or 
rendered ineffective by Applicable Law.

Annex I Risk disclosure statement 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 
Transaction and Exchange risks 
1.1 
Risks of Virtual Asset trading 
The prices of Virtual Assets fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. The price of a 
Virtual Asset may move up or down, and may become valueless. 
 
It is as likely that losses will be incurred rather than profit made as a result of 
buying and selling Virtual Assets. 
 
1.2 
Nature of Virtual Assets 
The Virtual Assets are not legal tender. They may not be backed by physical 
assets, and are not backed or guaranteed by a government. They may not have 
intrinsic value. Some of the Virtual Assets may not circulate freely or widely, and 
may not be listed on any secondary markets. 
 
Virtual Assets are generally a high-risk asset class. They may or may not be 
Securities. You should exercise caution in relation to the trading of Virtual 
Assets, and Virtual Assets themselves. 
 
Transactions involving Virtual Assets are irrevocable. Lost or stolen Virtual 
Assets may be irretrievable. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded 
on a blockchain, loss or stolen Virtual Assets generally will not be reversible. 
IMPORTANT 
Trading in Virtual Assets and using the Exchange involve risks, some of which 
are set out below. These risks, and additional risks arising either now or in the 
future, could result in the loss, failure or destruction of your assets, inability to 
receive any benefits available to you, other losses and termination of the 
Exchange. 
You must consider carefully whether the risks set out below, as well as all other 
applicable risks, are acceptable to you prior to any Order. 
You must seek professional advice regarding your particular situation before 
trading in Virtual Assets or using the Exchange. You must also check the latest 
terms applicable as they may change from time to time. 
THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIRTUAL ASSETS CAN BE 
SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER 
SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR 
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, YOUR TOLERANCE 
TO RISKS AND YOUR INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. YOU SHOULD BE CAPABLE 
OF BEARING A FULL LOSS OF THE AMOUNTS INVESTED AS A RESULT OF OR 
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ORDER AND ANY ADDITIONAL LOSS OVER AND 
ABOVE THE INITIAL AMOUNTS INVESTED THAT MAY BECOME DUE AND 
OWING BY YOU. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR INVEST, YOU 
SHOULD INFORM YOURSELF AND BE AWARE OF THE RISKS GENERALLY, 
AND IN PARTICULAR SHOULD NOTE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC RISK 
FACTORS WHICH MAY APPLY TO ANY GIVEN ORDER. 
63 
 
1.3 
Reliance on distributed ledger technology 
Virtual Assets rely on various types of distributed ledger technology. Some of 
this technology is open source software that is built upon experimental 
technology, namely blockchain. Risks arising from this reliance include the 
existence of technical flaws in the technology, targeting by malicious persons, 
majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks, changes in the 
consensus protocol or algorithms, decreased community or miner support, rapid 
fluctuations in value of relevant Virtual Assets, the existence or development of 
competing networks, platforms and assets, flaws in the scripting language, 
disputes between developers, miners and/or users and regulatory action. 
 
1.4 
Virtual Assets may be complex products 
Virtual Assets may be complex products by virtue that the terms, features and/or 
risk are not readily understood due to the complex structure, novelty and reliance 
on technological features. 
 
1.5 
Volatility of Virtual Assets 
The value of the Virtual Assets may fluctuate significantly over a short period of 
time. The volatile and unpredictable fluctuations in price may result in significant 
losses over of short period of time. 
 
Any Virtual Asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various 
factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, change to 
the nature or properties of the Virtual Asset, governmental or regulatory activity, 
legislative changes, suspension or cessation of support for a Virtual Assets or 
other exchanges or service providers, public opinion, or other factors outside of 
our control. Technical advancements, as well as broader economic and political 
factors, may cause the value of Virtual Assets to change significantly over a short 
period of time. 
 
1.6 
Market, liquidity and conversion risk 
Where an Order is denominated in particular Virtual Assets other than your 
primary reference asset, or where you convert Assets following the Execution of 
an Order, there is a risk that if the exchange markets move against you, then 
upon maturity or any earlier dealing the net proceeds may be significantly less 
than the initial amount in your primary reference asset, and any income or gains 
may be entirely negated. 
 
The value of a particular Virtual Asset may decline, or be completely and 
permanent lost, should the market for that Virtual Asset disappear. There is no 
assurance that a market for a particular Virtual Asset will continue to do so in the 
future. This is because the value of an Asset may be derived, among other 
things, from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange that 
Virtual Asset. 
 
There is the possibility for you to experience losses due to the inability to sell or 
convert assets into a preferred alternative asset immediately or in instances 
where conversion is possible but at a loss. Such liquidity risk in an asset may be 
caused by the absence of buyers, limited buy/sell activity or underdeveloped 
secondary markets. 
 
There is no assurance that a person who accepts a Virtual Asset as payment, will 
continue to do in the future. 
 
You may also suffer loss as a result of depreciation of the value of the Virtual 
Asset paid as a result of controls imposed by a Government Agency. 
Repayment or payment of amounts due to you may be delayed or prevented by 
exchange controls or other actions imposed by governmental or regulatory 
bodies over Virtual Asset that they control or regulate. 
64 
 
1.7 
Not a deposit 
Without limiting clause 4.2(d), any Eligible Virtual Assets held by us are not held 
as “deposits”, nor are they intended to be held as any other regulated product or 
service under Applicable Law. 
 
1.8 
Risks associated with statutory protection schemes 
You should be aware that in comparison to other assets, including Fiat 
Currencies and trading: 
 
(a) 
any Order in respect of Virtual Assets may not subject to a right to claim 
under any investor compensation fund established by any Government 
Agency; and 
 
(b) 
any Virtual Assets held in an Account may not be protected deposits, 
and may not be protected by any deposit protection scheme in any 
jurisdiction. 
 
This means that Virtual Assets may have a reduced level or type of protection 
compared to Fiat Currencies, as well as other products and asset classes. 
 
1.9 
Commissions and fees 
(a) 
Before conducting any Order, you should obtain details of all 
commissions, fees and Costs for which you will be liable. 
 
(b) 
If any of the fees and Costs are not clear to you, you should request the 
fee and Costs that will be applicable in specific monetary terms before 
entering into an Order. 
 
1.10 
Risks of assets subject to other overseas laws 
Virtual Assets received or held by us may be are subject to other applicable laws 
and regulations of the relevant overseas jurisdictions. 
 
1.11 
Risks relating to Authorised Persons 
There are substantial risks in allowing another person to trade or operate your 
Account or any other account you have with us, and it is possible that 
Instructions could be given by persons who are note properly authorised. You 
accept all of the risks of such an operation and irrevocable release us from all 
liabilities arising out of or in connection with such Instructions. 
 
1.12 
Suspension of the Exchange and Network Events 
It may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position in the Virtual Assets under 
certain circumstances. Certain Network Events may occur rapidly and affect the 
ability to conduct transactions on the Exchange. Information relating to these 
Network Events may be difficult to ascertain ahead of time and may be subject to 
limited oversight by any third-party who is capable of intervening to stabilise the 
network. 
 
2 
Cybersecurity and technology-related risks 
2.1 
Loss of private key is permanent and irreversible 
You alone are responsible for securing your private key in respect of any 
address. 
 
Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you 
access to your Virtual Assets. Neither we nor any other person will be able to 
retrieve or protect your Virtual Asset. Once lost, you will not be able to transfer 
65 
 
your Virtual Asset to any other address or wallet. You will not be able to realise 
any value or utility that the Virtual Asset may hold now or in future. 
 
2.2 
Transactions irreversible 
The nature of Virtual Asset transfers is that they are irreversible. This means 
accidental or fraudulent transactions in respect of Virtual Assets may not be 
recoverable. 
 
2.3 
Forks and attacks 
Virtual Assets may be subject to Forks or attacks on the security, integrity or 
operation of the networks, including Network Events. Such events may affect the 
features, functions, operation, use or other properties of any Virtual Asset, 
network or platform. 
 
The events may also severely impact the price or value of any Virtual Assets, or 
even result in the shutdown of the network or platform associated with the Virtual 
Asset. Such events may be beyond the control of Crypto.com, or to the extent 
Crypto.com has any ability to impact such event, Crypto.com’s decision or 
actions may not be in your interests. 
 
2.4 
Cyber-attacks and fraudulent activity 
The technologic reliance of the Exchange on the Internet exposes you to an 
increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack. Virtual Assets, an Account, a service, an 
Agreed Communication Method or a Trading Tool may be targeted by malicious 
persons who may attempt to steal Virtual Assets, or otherwise intervene in the 
Order or any of the Exchange. 
 
This includes (but is not limited to) interventions by way of: 
 
(a) 
distributed denial of service; 
 
(b) 
sybil attacks; 
 
(c) 
phishing; 
 
(d) 
social engineering; 
 
(e) 
hacking; 
 
(f) 
smurfing; 
 
(g) 
malware; 
 
(h) 
double spending; 
 
(i) 
majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks; 
 
(j) 
misinformation campaigns; 
 
(k) 
Forks; and 
 
(l) 
spoofing. 
 
Virtual Assets, Accounts, Agreed Communication Methods, Trading Tools or the 
Exchange may also be vulnerable to exploitation of vulnerabilities in smart 
contracts and other code, as well as to human error. 
 
A limited amount of your Virtual Assets may be stored in hot wallets (ie online 
environments which provide an interface with the internet), which can be prone to 
66 
 
hacking or cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks resulting in the hacking of virtual asset 
trading platforms and thefts of virtual assets are common. Victims may have 
difficulty recovering losses from hackers or trading platforms. This could result in 
significant loss and/or other impacts that may materially affect your interests. 
 
The above events may affect the features, functions, operation, use, access or 
other properties of the Virtual Assets, your Account, an Agreed Communication 
Method or the Exchange. 
 
2.5 
Targeting by malicious persons 
Malicious entities may target you in an attempt to steal any asset that you may 
hold, or to claim any asset that you may have purchased. This may involve 
unauthorised access to your Account, your private keys, your addresses, your 
passwords, your email or social media accounts, your log-in details or access 
method for the Account, as well as unauthorised access to your computer, 
smartphone and any other devices that you may use. 
 
You alone are responsible for protecting yourself against such actions. 
 
2.6 
Cryptographic advancements 
Developments in cryptographic technologies and techniques, including (but not 
limited to) the advancement of artificial intelligence and/or quantum computing, 
pose security risks to all cryptography-based systems including the Virtual 
Assets, the Account, Agreed Communication Methods or the Exchange. 
 
Applying these technologies and techniques to the Virtual Assets, an Account, 
Agreed Communication Method or the Exchange may result in theft, loss, 
disappearance, destruction, devaluation or other compromises of the Virtual 
Assets, an Account, Agreed Communications Methods, the Exchange or your 
data (as applicable). 
 
2.7 
Reliance on the internet and other technologies 
Virtual Assets and the Exchange rely heavily on the internet and other 
technologies (including the Agreed Communication Methods). However, the 
public nature of the internet means that either parts of the internet or the entire 
internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Further, interruption, 
delay, corruption or loss of data, the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of 
data, or the transmission of malware may occur when transmitting data via the 
internet and/or other technologies. The result of the above may be that your 
Order is not executed according to your instructions, at the desired time, or not at 
all. 
 
No authentication, verification or computer security technology is completely 
secure or safe. 
 
The internet or other electronic media (including without limitation electronic 
devices, services of third-party telecom service providers such as mobile phones 
or other handheld trading devices or interactive voice response systems) are an 
inherently unreliable form of communication, and such unreliability may be 
beyond Crypto.com’s control. 
 
Any information (including any document) transmitted, or communication or 
transactions made, over the internet or through other electronic media (including 
electronic devices, services of third party telecommunication service providers 
such as mobile phones or other handheld trading devices or interactive voice 
response systems) may be subject to interruption, transmission blackout, 
delayed transmission due to data volume, internet traffic, market volatility or 
incorrect data transmission (including incorrect price quotation) or stoppage of 
price data feed due to the public nature of the internet or other electronic media. 
67 
 
2.8 
Risks relating to timing 
An Order is binding upon completion of the steps described in these Exchange 
Terms and Conditions. Following this, the Order will not be reversed unless 
otherwise provided in this Agreement. There is a risk that the final binding Order 
does not occur at the same time as Instructions are provided. 
 
You may suffer loss due to the fact that an Order is not carried out at the desired 
time. In particular, contingent orders, such as “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” orders, 
may not limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may 
make it impossible to execute such Orders. 
 
2.9 
Unauthorised access 
Unauthorised third parties may access your Account and submit Orders without 
your knowledge or authorisation, whether by obtaining control over another 
device or account used by you, or by other methods. 
 
2.10 
Exchange materials may not be up to date 
Crypto.com is not obliged to provide any adaptations, enhancements and/or 
modifications to the Exchange Materials. This means, for example in relation to 
the App, that you may have an out of date version of the App, and new features 
may not be incorporated to the version of the App you use. It is your 
responsibility to ensure you update and download applicable updates and 
versions. 
 
2.11 
Use of Jailbroken devices 
The use of the App on a Jailbroken device may compromise security and lead to 
fraudulent transaction as well as an Event of Default. You may suffer loss as 
well as a termination of this Agreement. 
 
3 
General risk statements 
3.1 
Jurisdiction-related risks 
Residents, Tax residents or persons having a relevant connection with 
jurisdictions other than Available Jurisdictions are prohibited from using the 
Exchange and from submitting Orders. Changes in your place of domicile or 
Applicable Law may result in you violating any legal or regulatory requirements of 
your applicable jurisdiction. 
 
You are responsible for ensuring that any Order is, and remains lawful despite 
changes to Applicable Law, your residence and circumstances. 
 
3.2 
Product-related risks 
Crypto.com Group Members may have issued certain Virtual Assets, whereas 
other Virtual Assets are issued by third parties. 
 
In any event, you must read the applicable product terms, product information 
and risk disclosures carefully before entering into an Order. 
 
No product term or product information has been subject to regulatory approval, 
unless expressly stated otherwise. You should exercise caution in respect of any 
such offer. 
 
For any Virtual Asset products that have been authorised by a regulator, 
authorisation does not imply any official recommendation or endorsement of the 
product by the regulator, nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a 
product or its performance. 
68 
 
You should seek independent professional advice before making any investment 
decision. 
 
3.3 
Tax treatment and accounting 
Some Virtual Assets and Orders may be subject to the tax laws and regulations 
in an applicable jurisdiction. The tax treatment and accounting of Virtual Assets 
(and any ancillary benefits) is a largely untested area of law and practice that is 
subject to changes. Tax treatment of Virtual Assets may vary amongst 
jurisdictions. We may receive queries, notices, requests or summons from tax 
authorities and as a result may be required to furnish certain information about 
the Order. 
 
Among the accounting profession, there are no agreed standards and practices 
for how an auditor can perform assurance procedures to obtain sufficient audit 
evidence for the existence and ownership of the Virtual Assets, and ascertain the 
reasonableness of the valuations. 
 
If you are unsure about the tax implications of your Orders, you should seek 
independent professional advice before carrying out an Order. 
 
3.4 
Inflation Risk 
Virtual Assets may, either because of the inherent design of the Virtual Asset or 
through Network Events, not be a fixed supply of assets. Where additional 
Virtual Assets are created, the asset’s price may decline due to inflationary 
effects of adding additional Virtual Assets to the total assets available. 
 
3.5 
Concentration risk 
At any point in time, one or more persons may directly or indirectly control 
significant portions of the total supply of any particular Virtual Asset. Acting 
individually or in concert, these holders may have significant influence, and may 
be able to influence or cause Network Events which may have a detrimental 
effect on price, value or functionality of the Virtual Assets. Network Participants 
may make decisions that are not in your best interest as a holder of Virtual 
Assets. 
 
3.6 
Country risks 
If a transaction is made in any Virtual Asset issued by a party subject to foreign 
laws or transactions made on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets 
formally linked to a domestic market, recovery of the sums invested and any 
profits or gains may be reduced, delayed or prevented by exchange controls, 
debt moratorium or other actions imposed by the government or other official 
bodies. Before you submit an Order, you should satisfy yourself about any rules 
or laws relevant to that particular Order. 
 
Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the 
rules of regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your 
transactions have been effected. You should obtain independent advice about 
the different types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other 
relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade. If your country of residence 
imposes restrictions on Virtual Assets, we may be required to discontinue your 
access to the Account, and may not be permitted to transfer Virtual Assets back 
to you or permit you to transfer Virtual Assets from the Account to yourself or 
others, until such time as the regulatory environment permits us to do so. 
 
3.7 
Regulatory uncertainty 
All Virtual Asset are potentially exposed to legal and regulatory risks. The legal 
and regulatory treatment of some of the Virtual Assets may change. Regulation 
of Virtual Assets is unsettled and rapidly changing. Legal and regulatory 
69 
 
treatment varies according to the jurisdiction. The effect of regulatory and legal 
risk is that any Virtual Asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to 
legal or regulatory change. This may affect the value or potential profit of a 
Virtual Asset Order. 
 
We may cancel or modify your Order, restrict or suspend your use of the 
Exchange or your Account to comply with Applicable Law or for other reasons as 
specified in the Agreement. 
 
We recommend you obtain independent legal, tax and financial advice and that 
you continue to monitor the legal and regulatory position in respect of the Virtual 
Assets and your Orders. 
 
3.8 
Conflicts of interest 
We or other virtual asset trading platform operators may be acting as agents as 
well as principals for you. We or other service providers may facilitate the initial 
distribution of Virtual Assets (such as, initial coin offerings), facilitate secondary 
market trading, or both, as in a traditional exchange, alternative trading system or 
securities broker. If these operations are not under the purview of any regulator, 
it would be difficult to detect, monitor and manage conflicts of interest. 
 
3.9 
Authorised Persons 
Providing access to your Account to any other person involves risk. You must 
take all necessary steps to assure yourself that any Authorised Person is 
appropriate. You must also adopt such controls as you see fit to monitor the 
activities of such persons in relation to your Account to ensure they remain 
appropriate to act in that capacity.
