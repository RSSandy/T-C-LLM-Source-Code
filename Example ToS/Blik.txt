II. GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE BLIK SCHEME 
§ 3. 
1. The BLIK Scheme operates on a continuous basis, i.e. on each day of the year, twenty-four hours a 
day, excluding scheduled technical breaks. 
2. Payment transactions made using payment instruments issued within the framework of the BLIK 
Scheme are processed and cleared in Polish zloty. 
3. BLIK Transactions can be initiated by Users and Institutional Users, at any time during the operation 
of the BLIK Scheme. 
4. Mobile Transactions are cleared in net amounts, taking into account fees due to Issuers, Acquirers

5. Fees for services made available to Participants within the framework of the BLIK Scheme are 
calculated in accordance with the price list of services provided by PSP, attached as appendix no. 1

6. Organisational solutions of PSP as a payment organisation with respect to the structure and 
procedures for making decision with respect to the activities involving the processing of BLIK 
Transactions within the framework of the BLIK Payment Scheme should ensure stable and safe 
functioning of the BLIK Scheme, and guarantee PSP’s independence in terms of accounting, 
organisation and decision-making within the scope in question. 
7. PSP independently and autonomously determines the costs of the activities carried out, involving the 
processing of BLIK Transactions, and takes these costs into account when developing the financial 
model of its functioning as a payment organisation operating the BLIK Scheme. 
8. Principles of access to the BLIK Scheme are determined based on criteria that are objective, equal 
and proportional. Limitations of access to the BLIK Scheme cannot be greater than necessary in 
order to ensure the protection against specific risks, especially settlement risk, operational risk and 
business risk, and the financial and operational protection of the stability of the BLIK Scheme. 
9. As a payment organisation, PSP operates the BLIK System using its own technical infrastructure or 
establishes cooperation with providers, who as a result of mandating them to carry out tasks related

involving the provision of access to the payment instrument that allows commissioning the execution 
of BLIK Transactions. The Acquirer performs activities necessary to execute the BLIK Transaction, 
intermediating as the Participant of the BLIK Scheme and the BLIK System in the performance of 
the payment service provided to the User or the Institutional User by the Issuer making available the 
payment instrument in the form of a Mobile Application, service or function using the BLIK Code. 
9

5. Participants shall be authorised to use BLIK Codes or other functionalities made available within the 
framework of the BLIK Scheme, only for the purposes of the provision of service involving the 
processing of BLIK Transaction in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on Participation 
and the Regulations. 
 
6. The Participant shall be authorised to use the data made available in relation to participation in the BLIK 
Scheme and the BLIK System only for the purposes of proper fulfilment of obligations under the 
Agreement on Participation. 
14 
 
 
7. The Participant being the Acquirer processing, without the Securing Issuer’s participation, payments 
initiated outside the own network of the particular Acquirer as the Issuer, and executed using the BLIK 
Code, shall be obliged to ensure the security deposit in the amount equivalent to three times the average 
daily volume of withdrawals processed by this Acquirer and cleared in the BLIK System in the month 
preceding the month for which the deposit amount is calculated. The amount of the deposit that the 
Acquirer is obliged to ensure in a given month shall be calculated by PSP by the fifth day of the given 
calendar month, based on the date for the previous calendar month collected in the PSP System. The 
Acquirer shall be notified by PSP of the amount of the deposit required in the given month, by the 
seventh day of this month. 
 
8. The security deposit shall be paid by the Acquirer to the dedicated bank account of PSP. PSP cannot 
use the deposit for any purposes other than settlement of amounts due from the Acquirer to Issuers and 
PSP, resulting from Clearing. 
 
9. PSP shall be authorised to cover, from the deposit, amounts due to Participants of the BLIK System or 
PSP from the Acquirer in relation to settlements carried out in the BLIK System if these amounts are 
not covered by the Acquirer in accordance with the Operational Procedure for Participants – “Processing 
of the Acquirer’s counter position,” in the amount necessary to satisfy the Acquirer’s liabilities to the 
Issuer specified in § 12 section 2 of the Regulations. 
 
10. The use of the Deposit shall involve PSP ordering, from the deposit account, transfers to Issuers or PSP 
in order to satisfy amounts due to the Issuers or PSP from the Acquirer, within the scope and in the 
amount determined by PSP in accordance with the Regulations. If the PSP covers, from the Deposit, 
amounts due from the Acquirer to other Participants or PSP, the PSP obligation to return the deposit 
amount shall expire in the part that was used to satisfy claims of other Participants or PSP. 
 
11. If the actual amount of the deposit transferred by the Acquirer to the account referred to in section 8 is 
lower than the amount calculated by PSP in accordance with section 7, PSP shall call the Acquirer to 
supplement the deposit, whereas the Acquirer shall be obliged to supplement the deposit by the missing 
amount within no more than 3 working days of the request. If the current deposit is higher than the 
required deposit amount calculated by PSP for the given month, the Acquirer may request PSP to return 
the surplus to the specified bank account, whereas PSP shall return the surplus within three working 
days. 
 
12. The Acquirer’s failure to settle amounts due to the BLIK System in relation to the processing of 
payments or to supplement the deposit to the amount required in accordance with section 7 shall 
authorise PSP to take steps provided for in §19 of the Regulations. 
 
§ 8. 
1. Participants and PSP shall be held liable only for the consequences of their performance of activities 
related to the BLIK Transaction processing in a way inconsistent with the Agreement or the Regulations. 
15 
 
As a result, Participants and PSP shall not be responsible for the Merchant’s failure to provide the goods 
or services or for any inconsistencies of the parameters of the goods and/or services with the agreement 
between the User or the Institutional User and the Merchant. Such claims shall be resolved directly 
between the User or the Institutional User and the Merchant. 
 
2. The Acquirer shall be held liable to other Participants and PSP for the consequences resulting from the 
Acquirer or the Merchant inputting a BLIK Transaction into the PSP System in bad faith or as a result 
of a crime, including for unauthorised actions of third parties in the systems of the Acquirer or the 
Merchant. 
 
3. The Issuer shall be held liable to other Participants and PSP for the consequences resulting from the 
Issuer, User or the Institutional User inputting a BLIK Transaction into the PSP System in bad faith or 
as a result of a crime, including for unauthorised actions of third parties in the systems of the Issuer or 
in the Mobile Application. 
 
 
V. 
PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS AND OTHER NOTIFICATIONS 
§ 9. 
1. PSP shall process complaints and other notifications pertaining to the BLIK Scheme and the BLIK 
System based on the Ognivo system operated by KIR. In special cases (e.g. failure of the Ognivo 
system), the Participant shall be able to make the complaint or submit other notification to PSP via 
electronic mail or other communication system specified in the agreement concluded by and between 
PSP and the Participant or the Cooperating Scheme. 
2. Complaints and other notifications registered by Participants in the Ognivo system shall be sent to PSP. 
PSP shall carry out the investigation in order to process the complaint. 
3. PSP shall calculate a fee for processing the complaint, in the amount set in the price list attached as 
Appendix no. 1 to the Regulations, and the fee shall be borne by the Participant, whose non-performance 
or improper performance of obligations under the Agreement on Participation or the Regulations 
resulted in the event that provided a basis for making the complaint by another Participant. If, while 
processing the complaint it is determined that the complaint was made in circumstances in which neither 
any of the Participants nor PSP can be considered responsible for the non-performance or improper 
performance of the Agreement or the Regulations, the fee for processing the complaint shall be collected 
from the Participant that made this complaint. PSP shall waive the fee for processing the complaint in 
instances referred to in the Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, 
inquiries and complaints pertaining to mobile payments. 
4. In addition to the fee referred to in section 3, in the case of the Issuer making a complaint with respect 
to the BLIK-C Transaction cleared with the Cooperating Scheme, PSP shall collect from the Issuer the 
fee for the Cooperating Scheme or shall transfer to the Issuer the fee received from the Cooperating 
Scheme in the amount set in the price list attached as Appendix no. 2 to the Regulations. The procedure 
for collecting and settling the fees for the processing of complaints pertaining to BLIK-C Transactions 
16 
 
is described in the Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, inquiries and 
complaints pertaining to mobile payments. 
5. In the case of the complaint lodged by the Participant, including a specific claim made by the User, 
Institutional User, Merchant or the Participant, resulting from the non-performance or improper 
performance of obligations under the Agreement on Participation or the Regulations by PSP or another 
Participant, costs related to processing such claims shall be borne by the entity that failed to perform or 
improperly performed obligations under these documents. In the Ognivo system, PSP shall notify 
Participants taking part in the complaint review process of the outcome of the complaint proceedings 
carried out, indicating the Participant that caused the event providing a basis for the complaint, and the 
number of the account of the Participant, to which the Participant indicated by PSP is obliged to transfer 
the amount of the claim made. 
6. Any doubts with respect to identifying the entity responsible for the occurrence of the event providing 
a basis for the complaint shall be resolved by PSP. 
7. The Participant shall be obliged to review complaints and other notifications, and to submit to PSP any 
available documents and information required in the complaint process in accordance with the 
Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, inquiries and complaints pertaining 
to mobile payments, and within time frames specified in this procedure. 
8. PSP shall be obliged to review complaints and other notifications, and to submit to the Participant 
received documents and information required in the complaint process, and to correct the amount of the 
transaction subject to the complaint or to cancel the transaction subject to the complaint, provided that 
the need for such an operation arises from the Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of 
notifications, inquiries and complaints pertaining to mobile payments. 
9. In the case of the need to obtain additional information necessary to review the complaint, PSP shall 
request the responsible Participant to provide this information. The Participant shall be obliged to

10. PSP shall notify Participants involved in the complaint proceedings of the process thereof and, if 
necessary, shall send to Participants reminders in order to ensure meeting the agreed time limits for 
processing the complaint. 
11. The Participant’s failure to express an opinion on the complaint within the time limit set in the 
Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, inquiries and complaints pertaining 
to mobile payments shall be considered equivalent to this Participant recognising the complaint as 
justified and due to reasons attributable to this Participant. 
12. If the complaint made by the Participant is not considered justified, the Participant shall be entitled to 
request additional documentation justifying the refusal. 
13. In the case of the Participant making a complaint pertaining to the Mobile Transaction other than the 
one referred to in section 14, the correction of the amount of the transaction subject to the complaint or 
cancellation of the transaction subject to the complaint shall be made by PSP based on: 
17 
 
a) acceptance of the Participant that will be charged as a result of this correction or cancellation; 
or 
b) considering the complaint justified in accordance with the procedure specified in section 11. 
14. In the case of the Issuer making a complaint pertaining to the Mobile Transaction unauthorised by the 
User, to which the Acquirer affixed the message referred to in §11 section 7, and which was subject to 
the Authorisation by the Issuer without confirming this transaction by the User in the Mobile 
Application, the Acquirer shall be obliged to return the amount of such a transaction to this Issuer, 
unless the Acquirer provided the Issuer with the declaration confirming the proper execution of the 
Mobile Transaction in the system of the Acquirer and the Merchant, to which the Mobile Transaction 
subject to the complaint refers, and confirmed the application of technical and organisational solutions 
referred to in §11 section 7, whereas the position presented by the Acquirer with respect to the complaint 
was not disputed by the Issuer. 
15. To the declaration referred to in section 14, the Acquirer shall attach documents referred to in the 
Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, inquiries and complaints pertaining 
to mobile payments. 
16. PSP carrying out any operations as a result of complaint proceedings cannot be considered the ground 
for authorising the Participant or the User to conclude that the User participated in concluding the 
Mobile Transaction or received the goods or services paid for, or other benefits as a result of this 
transaction. 
§ 10. 
Corrections of amounts of transactions subject to complaints or cancellations of transactions subject to 
complaints referred to in §9 section 12, as well as returns of amounts referred to in §9 section 14, shall be 
made by PSP in accordance with the Operational Procedure for Participants – Processing of notifications, 
inquiries and complaints pertaining to mobile payments.. 
 
VI. 
AUTHORISATION OF BLIK TRANSACTIONS 
§ 11. 
1. The queue of orders in the BLIK System shall be managed in accordance with the First In, First Out 
rule. Consequently, BLIK Transactions shall be executed and Mobile Transactions shall also be cleared 
in the sequence of inputting the orders into the BLIK System. 
2. Authorisation of BLIK Transactions shall be carried out in the BLIK Scheme by Issuers, using BLIK 
Codes. 
3. The general model of executing BLIK Transactions using the One-Time Code generated by PSP 
involves the following stages: 
a. Generation of the One-Time Code by PSP: 
18 
 
At the request of the User submitted through the Mobile Application to the Issuer or at the request 
of the Institutional User submitted using a functionality other than the Mobile Application, made 
available by the Issuer, the Issuer sends to PSP the request to generate the One-Time Code. The 
One-Time Code is generated by PSP and returned to the Issuer. PSP keeps identifiers of the Issuer 
and the Mobile Account for which the One-Time Code was generated. The generated One-Time 
Code is displayed in the Mobile Application of the User or made available using another service or 
functionality made available by the Issuer. 
b. Entering the One-Time Code generated by PSP into the Accepting Device: 
The User or a natural person authorised by the Institutional User enters the One-Time Code 
generated by PSP into the Accepting Device. 
c. Transfer of the One-Time Code generated by PSP for Authorisation: 
The Accepting Device sends the One-Time Code generated by PSP together with details of the 
BLIK Transactions through the Acquirer to PSP. 
d. Verification of the One-Time Code generated by PSP in the BLIK System: 
Based on the One-Time Code previously generated by PSP, received from the Acquirer, PSP 
searches for the Mobile Account and identifies the Issuer, and sends to the Issuer details of the BLIK 
Transaction for Authorisation. 
e. Authorisation by the Issuer: 
In the Authorisation process, the Issuer makes the decision on executing the BLIK Transaction. 
f. Forwarding the response to the Accepting Device: 
The Issuer sends the decision on accepting or rejecting the Mobile Transaction to PSP. 
PSP, through the network of the Acquirer, forwards the decision on acceptance or rejection of the 
BLIK Transaction to the Accepting Device. 
 
4. The general model of executing BLIK Transactions using the One-Time Code registered in the PSP 
System based on the order of the Issuer involves the following stages: 
a. Downloading the One-Time Code from the Accepting Device: 
The User downloads the One-Time Code from the Accepting Device to the Mobile Application. 
The One-Time Code is then transferred to the IT system managed by the Issuer, and transferred by 
the Issuer to the PSP System in order to register this code in connection with the Mobile Account 
of the User. PSP keeps identifiers of the Issuer and the Mobile Account for which the One-Time 
Code was registered. 
b. Transfer of the One-Time Code for Authorisation: 
The Accepting Device sends the One-Time Code downloaded by the User together with details of 
the BLIK Transactions through the Acquirer to PSP. 
c. Verification of the One-Time Code by PSP in the BLIK System: 
Based on the One-Time Code received from the Acquirer, PSP verifies whether the particular One-
Time Code was registered in PSP based on the previous order of the Issuer, and if it was, identifies 
the Mobile Account and the Issuer and sends to the Issuer details of the BLIK Transaction for 
Authorisation. 
d. Authorisation by the Issuer: 
In the Authorisation process, the Issuer makes the decision on executing the BLIK Transaction. 
e. Forwarding the response to the Accepting Device: 
The Issuer sends the decision on accepting or rejecting the Mobile Transaction to PSP. 
19 
 
PSP, through the network of the Acquirer, forwards the decision on acceptance or rejection of the 
BLIK Transaction to the Accepting Device. 
 
5. The general model of executing BLIK Transactions using the Alias registered in the PSP System based 
on the order of the Issuer involves the following stages: 
a. Forwarding the Alias to the PSP System: 
The User reports the Alias, in accordance with the agreement concluded with the Issuer, to the 
Issuer, who forwards this Alias to the PSP System in order to register this Alias in connection with 
the Mobile Account of the User. PSP keeps identifiers of the Issuer and the Mobile Account for 
which the Alias was registered. 
b. Obtaining the Alias by the Accepting Device: 
The Accepting Device obtains the Alias in a way specified in the Technical Specification for 
Participants. 
c. Forwarding the Alias for Authorisation: 
The Accepting Device sends the Alias together with details of the BLIK Transactions through the 
Acquirer to PSP. 
d. Verification of the Alias by PSP: 
Based on the Alias received from the Acquirer, PSP verifies whether the particular Alias was 
registered in the PSP System based on the previous order of the Issuer, and if it was, identifies the 
Mobile Account and the Issuer, and sends to the Issuer details of the BLIK Transaction for 
Authorisation. 
e. Authorisation by the Issuer: 
In the Authorisation process, the Issuer makes the decision on executing the BLIK Transaction. 
f. Forwarding the response to the Accepting Device: 
The Issuer sends the decision on accepting or rejecting the Mobile Transaction to PSP. 
PSP, through the network of the Acquirer, forwards the decision on acceptance or rejection of the 
BLIK Transaction to the Accepting Device. 
 
6. The general model of executing C-BLIK Transactions involves the following stages: 
a. Forwarding the Alias to the PSP System: 
The User reports the Alias, in accordance with the agreement concluded with the Issuer, to the 
Issuer, who forwards this Alias to the PSP System in order to register this Alias in connection with 
the Mobile Account of the User. PSP keeps identifiers of the Issuer and the Mobile Account for 
which the Alia was registered, and obtains a token from the Tokenisation System. PSP forwards the 
token to the Issuer in order to pass this token to the Mobile Application. 
b. Obtaining the Alias by the Accepting Device: 
The Accepting Device obtains the token from the Mobile Application. 
c. Forwarding the BLIK-C Transaction for Authorisation: 
The Accepting Devices sends the token together with details of the BLIK-C Transaction through 
the acquirer of the Cooperating Scheme to the Tokenisation System. The Cooperating Scheme, 
using the Tokenisation System, sends the token together with details of the BLIK-C Transaction to 
PSP. 
20 
 
d. Verification of the Alias by PSP: 
Based on the token received from the Cooperating Scheme, PSP verifies whether the particular Alias 
related to the particular token was registered in the PSP System based on the previous order of the 
Issuer, and if it was, identifies the Mobile Account, and sends to the Issuer details of the BLIK 
Transaction for Authorisation. 
e. Authorisation by the Issuer: 
In the Authorisation process, the Issuer makes the decision on executing the BLIK-C Transaction. 
f. Forwarding the response to the Accepting Device: 
The Issuer sends the decision on acceptance or rejection of the BLIK-C Transaction to PSP, whereas 
PSP forwards this decision to the Cooperating Scheme that, through the Tokenisation System and 
through the acquirer cooperating with the Cooperating Scheme, forwards it to the Accepting Device. 
7. At the request of the Participant acting as the Acquirer, PSP may, on conditions set out in the Technical 
Specification for Participants, allow to send to Issuers a message with a recommendation pertaining to 
the Authorisation of the BLIK Transaction without the User confirming in each case the order in the 
Mobile Application. The Issuer shall not be obliged to take into account the recommendation included 
in the message referred to in the previous sentence, whereas the Acquirer shall be obliged to apply 
proper technical and organisational solutions aimed at reducing risk of execution of unauthorised 
transactions using the functionality described in the previous sentence. 
§ 12. 
1. The BLIK Transaction order shall be considered entered into the PSP System upon forwarding the BLIK 
Code together with details of the BLIK Transactions to PSP. Authorisation of BLIK Transactions by 
the Issuer shall be irrevocable. After Authorisation by the Issuer, the BLIK Transaction order cannot be 
cancelled by the Participant or a third party. 
2. By issuing an Authorisation for forwarding the Mobile Transaction for Clearing, the Issuer undertakes 
to pay the Acquirer or the Cooperating Scheme for the Mobile Transaction through the BLIK System. 
If the Mobile Transaction forwarded for Clearing within the framework of the BLIK System involves 
the transfer of cash to the User’s account operated by the Issuer, the Acquirer undertakes to pay the 
Issuer the amount resulting from Clearing.  
3. Decisions taken by the Issuer as part of the Authorisation have to be permanently entered in the IT 
system of the Issuer and the Acquirer. 
4. The Mobile Transaction authorised by the Issuer can be cancelled by PSP or the Acquirer in the case of 
a technical error. 
5. The Mobile Transaction can be cancelled or corrected within 13 months from the day of Authorisation 
of the Mobile Transaction. 
§ 13. 
21 
 
1. In order to reduce operational risk related to executing Mobile Transactions, the Participant can forward 
Mobile Transactions for Authorisation for the amount not exceeding the limit for a single transaction 
set in the Technical Specification for Participants. 
2. In the case of BLIK Transaction forwarded for Authorisation for the amount exceeding the limit set for 
a single Mobile Transaction, the PSP System shall reject the BLIK Transaction, while providing the 
appropriate error code. 
§ 14. 
PSP shall report detected unauthorised BLIK Transactions to the NBP in compliance with applicable legal 
regulations. 
§ 15.

BLIK System. 
 
 
VIII. 
SUSPENSION AND EXCLUSION OF THE PARTICIPANT 
§ 17. 
1. Upon receiving the decision of the PFSA or another competent supervisory authority on suspending the 
activities of the Participant, or in the case of triggering the Settlement guarantee due to lack of sufficient 
funds on the account of the Issuer, PSP shall initiate the procedure for excluding the Participant from 
the BLIK Scheme and the BLIK System. 
22 
 
2. The exclusion procedure will start with suspending the Participant (blocking the account) in the BLIK 
Scheme and in the BLIK System, which will result in the Participant’s inability to execute BLIK 
Transactions within the framework of the BLIK Scheme and the BLIK System. 
3. After one month of the event referred to in section 1, the Participant will be excluded from the BLIK 
Scheme and the BLIK System if the Participant fails to effectively implement the steps aimed at

posing a risk of triggering the Settlement guarantee. 
§ 18. 
1. Based on a written statement on closing the current account of the Issuer with the NBP, provided by the 
NBP, PSP shall initiate the procedure for excluding the Issuer from the BLIK Scheme and the BLIK 
System. 
2. On the day of closing the current account of the Issuer with the NBP, the Issuer will be suspended, 
which means that the account of the Issuer being the direct Participant and accounts of Issuers being 
indirect Participants using the account of the Issuer being the direct Participant in the BLIK Scheme and 
the BLIK System will be blocked for one month. 
3. After one month of the event referred to in section 2, the Issuer will be excluded from the BLIK Scheme

24 
 
XI. 
RULES FOR EXECUTING P2P AND P2P-R TRANSACTIONS 
§ 23. 
1. The process of executing P2P Transactions in the BLIK System is carried out by using the Mobile 
Accounts database and by internal clearing carried out by the Issuer, or by using SPN or the BLIK 
System. The general model of the P2P Transaction involves the following stages: 
a. P2P Transaction order 
The order for executing a P2P Transaction shall be placed with the Issuer using the Mobile Application 
in the case of Users or using the tele-information system made available by the Issuer in the case of 
Institutional Users. When placing the order, the User or the Institutional User shall identify the Alias 
assigned previously in the BLIK System to the Mobile Account of the recipient for the purposes of 
executing the P2P Transaction and the transaction amount. 
b. Obtaining the NRB number from the Mobile Accounts database 
The Issuer, who will receive the P2P Transaction order from the User or the Institutional User, shall 
send the inquiry with the Alias received in the order to the Mobile Accounts database. PSP shall provide 
the Issuer implementing the transfer order with the NRB number assigned in the Mobile Accounts 
database to the Alias sent in the inquiry. If the Alias is not included in the Mobile Accounts database, 
in response the Issuer will receive an error message, and the Issuer shall notify the User or the 
Institutional User, who ordered the execution of the P2P Transaction, of the inability to execute this 
P2P Transaction. 
c. Forwarding the P2P Transaction for execution within the framework of internal clearing carried out by 
the Issuer, or for clearing in the Instant Transfer System or the BLIK System. 
After obtaining the NRB number from the Mobile Accounts database, the Issuer shall enter this number 
into the payment order and shall forward the complete transfer prepared in such a way for internal 
clearing if he maintains a bank account of both parties to the transaction, otherwise, the Issuer shall 
forward the transaction for clearing in the Instant Transfer System or in the BLIK System in accordance 
with the procedure described in the Technical Specification for Participants. In the case of using Express 
ELIXIR, the transfer is forwarded for clearing, while indicating MP2P as the service type. 
2. The general model of executing the P2P-R Transaction involves the following stages: 
a. Sending the transfer request by the User initiating the P2P-R Transaction. 
By providing the Alias assigned previously in the BLIK System to the Mobile Account, the User 
identifies the User to whom the transfer request is addressed. The User requesting the transfer shall 
specify the amount and optionally the transfer title. The Issuer shall forward the data provided by the 
User together with the first name, surname and telephone number of the User to the BLIK System. 
When forwarding the message with the transfer request to the PSP System, in this message, the Issuer 
includes preferences with respect to the manner of clearing the P2P-R Transaction in accordance with 
the requirements set forth in the Technical Specification for Participants. 
b. Identification of the User being the transfer sender 
After receiving from the Issuer the message – transfer request including details specified in item a 
above, based on the Alias forwarded in the message with the transfer request, the PSP System shall 
identify the Mobile Account of the User to whom the transfer request is addressed, and forwards the 
message to the Issuer providing services to this User. If the Mobile Accounts database does not include 
the Alias corresponding to the data included in the message with the transfer request, in response, the 
25 
 
Issuer who forwarded the message with the transfer request will receive from the PSP System an error 
message, and the Issuer shall notify the User of the inability to forward the transfer request. 
c. Acceptance of the transfer request 
The Issuer providing services to the User, to whom the transfer request is addressed, will receive from 
the PSP system a message with the transfer request. The Issuer shall present the transfer request to the 
User in the Mobile Application, while disclosing the first name and surname of the User – sender of the 
transfer request, amount and title of the transfer, if specified in the transfer request. If the User accepts 
the transfer request in the Mobile Application, the Issuer providing services to this User shall send to 
the PSP System a message notifying of accepting the transfer request, and shall forward the P2P-R 
Transaction for clearing in the Instant Transfer System or for clearing in the BLIK System. 
d. Clearing of P2P-R Transactions 
P2P-R Transactions shall be cleared in the Instant Transfer System or in the BLIK System. In the case 
of using Express ELIXIR, the transfer is forwarded for clearing, while indicating MP2P as the service 
type. Regardless of the manner of the transaction clearing, the Issuer providing services to the User who 
sent the transfer request, shall credit the account of this User immediately after receiving from the PSP 
System the notification of accepting the transfer request. P2P and P2P-R Transactions can be cleared in 
the BLIK System only when both Issuers providing services to both Users to whom the transaction 
pertains, have implemented the technical and organisational solutions specified in the Technical 
Specification for Participants. 
 
 
XII. 
DATA ARCHIVING AND REPORTING

FINAL PROVISIONS 
§ 27. 
1. PSP will, unilaterally and independently, determine the amount of fees due to Issuers and Acquirers for 
the execution of Mobile Transactions within the framework of the BLIK Scheme, and clearing thereof 
in the BLIK System. Fees, referred to in the previous sentence, will be charged by PSP as part of 
Clearing made for each Mobile Transaction.

as well as differentiate these fees depending on the type of Mobile Transactions, based on justified, 
objective and verifiable criteria. 
3. PSP shall unilaterally determine the amount of fees due to PSP from Participants in relation to PSP 
services provided to Participants. The price list specifying the amount of fees and other costs related to 
participation in the BLIK System constitutes an integral part of the Regulations. 
4. PSP shall be the only entity managing the Mark. Based on rights granted under the licence, PSP and 
Participants shall use the mark for the purposes of marking points accepting and executing BLIK 
Transactions, for the purposes of marking services offered within the framework of the BLIK Scheme,

month period for adjustment. PSP shall unilaterally amend provisions of the Terms in Conditions in 
each case taking into account applicable legal regulations and provisions of the Agreement on 
Participation.

6. Provisions of amended Regulations can be binding on the Participant and PSP before the expiry of the 
two-month adjustment period if the amendment to the Regulations refers to Participant’s rights that are 
not in conflict with the rights of other Participants. Bounding the Participant and PSP by the amended 
version of the Regulations as specified in the previous sentence shall require concluding an appropriate 
annex to the Agreement on Participation. 
7. Concluding the Agreement on Participation with PSP shall result in automatic inclusion of the 
Participant in the BLIK Payment Scheme and the BLIK Payment System, regardless of the date of 
concluding the Agreement. 
8. Matters not regulated herein shall be governed by provisions of the Agreement on Participation and the 
Regulations, and appropriate provisions of universal law.

pertaining to the use of the ELIXIR system concluded by and between the particular Participant and 
KIR, taking into consideration the provisions presented below. 
2. Settlement orders submitted in the ELIXIR system by Participants of the BLIK System through PSP

24 August on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and the rules for 
monitoring these systems (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2013, item 246). 
29 
 
3. Except for the situation described below, Settlement shall take place within one working day. In the 
case of errors occurring during the first or second session of the ELIXIR system on 24 December and 
on the last clearing day of each year, in at least one file submitted for clearing in the ELIXIR system, or 
inconsistency of transfer sums, Settlement shall take place on the next clearing day during the first 
session of the ELIXIR system, after PSP forwards to KIR correct files with liabilities related to the 
Clearing of Mobile Transactions for the previous clearing day, whereas Settlement of current liabilities 
related to Mobile Transaction Clearing for this subsequent clearing day shall be deferred to the second 
session of the ELIXIR system on this next day. PSP shall immediately notify Participants of the inability 
to carry out Settlement during the particular ELIXIR session. 
4. Settlement in the ELIXIR system shall be carried out Monday to Friday excluding statutory holidays in 
the territory of the Republic of Poland. Mobile Transactions shall be processed in the hours specified in 
the “Schedule of clearing runs in electronic clearing systems of KIR S.A.”: 
a) during the first session; 
b) during the second session in the case of triggering the Settlement guarantee mechanism or as a result 
of Settlement deferral referred to in section 3 above; 
c) during the third session, in the case of errors occurring during the first session of the ELIXIR system, 
in at least one settlement file submitted for Settlement in the ELIXIR system, or inconsistency of transfer 
sums after PSP forwards the correct files again to KIR, except for 24 December and the last clearing 
day of the year, when correctly prepared files shall be processed during the first session on the next 
clearing day, in accordance with section 3 above. 
5. Settlement shall be carried out in the bilateral model, using the Technical Account kept for PSP at a 
commercial bank. 
6. Data for the purposes of Settlement forwarded by the BLIK System shall include information on the 
liabilities of each of the Issuers to the BLIK System and the receivables of each of the Acquirers and 
Cooperating Schemes due from the BLIK System, taking into account fees due to Issuers and Acquirers. 
In the case of Acquirers being Secured Agents, the data for the purposes of Settlement forwarded by the 
BLIK System shall include information on the liabilities of Secured Agents to the BLIK System or 
information on the receivables of Secured Agents due from the BLIK System, taking into account fees 
due to Issuers and Acquirers. 
7. Based on Settlement data generated by the PSP System and relevant powers of attorney granted to KIR 
by the Issuer, KIR – on behalf of the Issuer – shall input the transfer order covering the liabilities of the 
Issuer to the BLIK System (single liability amount net), and in the case of the Issuer being the Securing 
Issuer – the transfer order covering the liabilities of Secured Agents to the BLIK System. During the 
same session, accounts of Acquirers, including Secured Agents and the Cooperating Scheme, will be 
credited with single transfers from the Technical Accounts. 
8. Settlement shall take place during one session of the ELIXIR system. Funds shall not be retained by the 
bank maintaining the Technical Account. 
9. The balance of the Technical Account before and after the PSP Clearing Session will be PLN zero. 
30 
 
10. In the case of triggering the Settlement guarantee due to insufficient funds on the account of the Issuer 
with the NBP and withdrawal of at least one transfer pertaining to the BLIK System from the ELIXIR 
system, all other orders generated by the BLIK System will also be withdrawn by KIR, and clearing in 
the first session of ELIXIR will not be performed. At the same time, PSP will block in the PSP System, 
the account of the Issuer that failed to ensure sufficient funds in the BLIK System, which will result in 
the Issuer’s inability to execute further Mobile Transactions in the BLIK System. In the case of blocking 
the account of the Issuer being the Securing Issuer in the PSP System, the accounts of Secured Agents 
for whom the blocked Securing Issuer keeps accounts for the purposes of the processing of Mobile 
Transactions entered into the BLIK System by these Secured Agents, will be automatically blocked, as 
a result these Secured Agents will be unable to enter Mobile Transactions into the BLIK System. PSP 
shall immediately notify the NBP of blocking the account of the Participant in the PSP System and of 
triggering the settlement guarantee procedure. 
11. Within the BLIK System, Participants being Issuers, including the Participants being Securing Issuers, 
shall guarantee making available funds for the purposes of Settlement if any of the Issuers, including 
the Issuer being the Securing Issuer, does not have sufficient funds for the purposes of Settlement. 
12. For the purposes of Settlement during the sessions of the Elixir system referred to in section 10 above, 
PSP shall again prepare the data for the purposes of Settlement, while increasing the liabilities of 
remaining Issuers by the amount that was not covered by any of the Issuer, in accordance with the 
principles and template set forth in the Operational Procedure for Participants – Settlement Guarantee 
Processing, and KIR shall enter new transfer orders to the ELIXIR system on behalf of the Issuer(s). 
13. If any of the Issuers responsible for covering the liabilities of another Issuer(s) fails to provide cash to 
cover the liabilities of another Issuer(s) within the framework of the Settlement during the second 
session of the Elixir system, the Mobile Transaction will not be subject to Settlement. In such case, 
direct bilateral clearing between Issuers and Acquirers and the Cooperating Scheme shall take place, of 
which the NBP will be informed. PSP shall prepare individual reports constituting payment orders, 
based on which Issuers shall conduct bilateral clearing with other Participants. In the event of initiating 
the bilateral clearing process, Issuers shall be obliged to make, in accordance with PSP orders, transfers 
in the ELIXIR system, in the amounts and to the Acquirers, including Secured Agents, or to the 
Cooperating Scheme, or to other Issuers, whose Users executed Mobile Transactions input into the 
BLIK System by Secured Agents, or to make, in accordance with PSP orders, clearing on accounts kept 
by these Issuers as Securing Issuers for Secured Agents. 
14. The Issuer who failed to ensure sufficient funds, including the Securing Issuer, undertakes to 
immediately reimburse other Issuers, including Securing Issuers, for the equivalent of all amounts paid 
by these Issuers, plus statutory interest. 
15. Detailed rules for using the Settlement Guarantee are set forth in the Operational Procedure for 
Participants – Settlement Guarantee Processing. 
§ 5. 
Matters not regulated herein shall be governed by provisions of the Agreement on Participation and the
