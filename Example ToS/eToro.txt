Regulatory status of our Services 
Trading Services and the Appropriateness Assessment 
3.1 
The Trading Services is an execution-only service. This means that you will be responsible for all 
investment decisions and actions with respect to the trades that you enter into. This includes, but is 
not limited to, opening, closing, or not opening or closing, a transaction. The capacities that we trade 
in on your behalf, including whether as principal or as agent, are set on in the Schedule(s) that apply 
to the Services that you use. 
3.2 
You may be trading a complex product, for example CFDs, when you use our Trading Services. Before 
you trade in a complex product, we are required to assess whether the product is appropriate for you 
(the "Appropriateness Assessment"). We do this by obtaining from you information about your 
investment knowledge and experience in trading such products, and assessing that information.  
3.3 
If we consider that the complex product is inappropriate for you, or if you do not provide us with the 
required information to conduct the Appropriateness Assessment, we may not allow you to trade in 
such instruments or we will provide you with a warning in relating to the trading of such instruments. 
Copy Trading Services and the Suitability Assessment  
3.4 
The Copy Trading Services is a limited form of discretionary investment management. This means that, 
before you can engage in a copy trade, we are required to assess whether our services are suitable for 
you (the "Suitability Assessment"). This is done by obtaining from you information about your 
investment knowledge and experience in copy trading, your investment objectives, including your risk 
tolerance, and your financial situation, including whether you can financially bear losses consistent with 
your investment objective.  
3.5 
If we consider that our Copy Trading Services are not suitable for you as a result of the Suitability 
Assessment, in accordance with our obligations under Applicable Law and our internal policy and 
procedures, or if you do not provide us with the required information to conduct the Suitability 
Assessment, you will not be able to enter into copy trades on the eToro platform. 
3.6 
We may update your Suitability Assessment from time to time. If there has been a change to your 
knowledge, experience, financial situation, or investment objectives, including your risk tolerance, you 
should advise us, so that we can update your Suitability Assessment. 
Information provided by you 
3.7 
You agree and acknowledge that the Appropriateness Assessment and/or the Suitability Assessment 
are performed on the basis of information and documents provided by you, and we may rely upon the 
information and documents provided by you and we are not responsible for any damages or losses 
which may arise from any inaccuracies. In addition, you agree to immediately notify us of any changes 
to the information and documents which you have provided, and to provide use with up to date, 
accurate and complete information to enable us to conduct each Appropriateness Assessment, and/or 
Suitability Assessment, at our reasonable request. 
 
 
 
5 
 
4. 
Limitations to our Services 
4.1 
We do not provide personalised investment recommendations or investment or tax related advice. Any 
explanation or information which we give to you as part of a trade, or a copy trade, or about the 
performance of the trade or copy trade is not intended to be, and should not be considered as advice. 
4.2 
The eToro trading platform is not an exchange or a market. This means that: 
(a) 
you can only enter into trades and investments with us on the platform, and not third parties; 
(b) 
all trades opened on our platform must be closed on our platform; 
(c) 
all products which you purchase on our platform can only be sold on our platform, and not a 
third party platform; 
(d) 
you will generally not be able to transfer products into your eToro account, out of your eToro 
account or to a third party at any time. However, we reserve the right to permit and support 
this functionality at our discretion, including, for example, the ability for you to transfer certain 
products between your eToro account and electronic wallets operate by an eToro Europe affiliate; 
and 
(e) 
our prices will be different from the prices provided by other brokers, the market price, as well 
as the current prices on any exchanges or trading platforms. 
4.3 
Therefore, you expressly consent to us executing orders outside of a regulated market, multilateral 
trading facility, or organised trading facility, in the manner described in these Terms and Conditions, 
the relevant Schedule, and the Best Execution and Order Handling Policy. 
4.4 
We may not provide all of our Services to customers domiciled in certain countries due to restrictions 
under Applicable Law, or restrictions under our internal policies (these are known as "restricted 
countries"). If you are a resident of a restricted country, you may be able to access some of our 
Services, but not all of our Services. We may change the list of restricted countries, as well as the 
Services that are available in a restricted country, from time to time. For further information, please 
speak to us, our contact details are available in clause 10 – "Communicating with you". 
4.5 
We will not accept applications for eToro accounts from residents domiciled in Canada, or residents or 
citizens of the United States of America, as well as other countries as required by Applicable Law, or 
required by our internal policies from time to time (these are known as "blocked countries"). We may 
change the list of blocked countries from time to time. For further information, please speak to us. Our 
contact details are available in clause 10 – "Communicating with you".  
4.6 
Our Services may not be available in a blocked country. If you are travelling to a blocked country, you 
may not have access to your eToro account or any of our Services. This restriction applies even if you 
do not normally reside in the blocked country. We are not liable for any loss which results from your 
inability to access the eToro platform because you are in a blocked country, or if caused by 
circumstances outside of our control. 
5. 
The key risks of using our Services 
5.1 
The risk of using our Services, is that you could lose all your money which you have deposited into 
your eToro account. Therefore you should not trade or invest money that you cannot afford to lose. It 
is important that you fully understand the risks involved before deciding to trade with us in light of 
your financial resources, level of experience, and risk appetite. If required, you should seek advice from 
an independent financial advisor.  
5.1 
The actual returns and losses experienced by you will vary depending on many factors, including, but 
not limited to, market behaviour, market movement, and your trade size.  
5.2 
The value of your investments may go up or down. 
5.3 
Past performance is not a guide to future performance. 
 
6 
 
5.4 
Your eToro account and our Services are provided in US Dollars. This means that transactions with 
eToro will carry an inherent foreign exchange risk, unless all the money that you put into and take out 
of your eToro account is in US Dollars.  
5.5 
More information on the risks associated with using each of the Services is set out in each Schedule, 
the General Risk Disclosure, and on our website. 
Digital trading platform 
5.6 
When you trade on a digital platform, such as the eToro platform, there is a risk that you will lose 
money as a result of: 
(a) 
the failure of your computer/mobile/digital device (including its battery); 
(b) 
a weak internet connection, or a weak mobile connection, which means you may not be able to 
connect to the eToro trading platform, or if you are able to connect there may be a delay; 
(c) 
hacking or the use of malicious software that allows a third party to gain access to your 
information and/or assets; 
(d) 
your device being incompatible with the eToro trading platform or system specifications, 
including due to incorrect settings or system specifications; 
(e) 
the failure or malfunction of eToro's or your hardware or software; and/or 
(f) 
your non-adherence with the eToro Security Guidance, available on our website at 
https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/etoro-security-guidelines/.  
5.7 
Some of the features available on the eToro trading platform may not be available if you are accessing 
the platform on a mobile device. 
You must monitor your trades 
5.8 
If you believe you have an order or trade that is not showing on the eToro trading platform, or have 
any other issue or problem with any order or trade, you should contact us immediately.  
6. 
Best execution 
6.1 
We are required to take sufficient steps to achieve the best possible result for you, on a consistent 
basis, when providing our Services. Our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy sets out the 
procedures that we follow as well as the relevant market factors that we take into account as part of 
our best execution obligation. This policy, which may be amended from time to time, forms part of our 
Agreement with you and is available on our website. 
6.2 
We understand that the best execution result is one that produces the best possible financial result for 
you, and that the "best possible financial result" is the best possible result in combination across all 
your trades. This means that some trades, taken individually, may be less favourable. Where we 
reasonably believe that it is in the overall best interest of all our clients, we may combine your order 
with our own orders or those of other clients, or we may split your orders. Best interests are not solely 
determined by price, and we also consider other factors, such as the speed of the trade and the 
likelihood of the trade being successful, to be important. Aggregation or splitting of orders may result 
in you obtaining, on some occasions, more favourable terms or price, and, on other occasions, less 
favourable terms or price than if your order had been executed separately. 
6.3 
We monitor the effectiveness of our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy on a regular basis to 
ensure that we consistently achieve the best results for you. 
 
 
 
7 
 
7. 
Conflicts of interests 
7.1 
We are required to act in your best interest when providing our Services. However, there may be 
instances where your interests conflict with our interests, or with another client's interests. For example: 
(a) 
we may execute hedging transactions before or after entering into a transaction with you to 
manage our risk in relation to the transaction, which may impact the price you pay or receive 
for such transactions, and we will retain any profits generated by such hedging. However, we 
are not required to hedge transactions if we do not want to; 
(b) 
we may enter into arrangements with third parties, or with other clients, where we make 
payments to them or receive payments from them based on your trading activity or volume, 
where such arrangements are permitted by Applicable Law. These payments may include 
rebates, commissions, widened spreads and profit sharing;  
(c) 
we may provide, pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits where such 
payments are permitted by Applicable Law;  
(d) 
we may share dealing charges with our affiliate companies or receive remuneration from them 
in respect of transactions carried out on your behalf;  
(e) 
we may be the counterparty to trades that you enter into; and 
(f) 
we are responsible for setting the price of instruments and products which can be traded on 
the eToro platform. This means that our prices will be different from the prices provided by 
other brokers and the market price, as well as the current prices on any exchanges or trading 
platforms. 
7.2 
We have in place a number of internal policies and arrangements to help manage any conflicts including 
as set out in our Conflicts of Interest Policy and which is available on our website. In addition, the 
potential conflicts related to trading detailed above are subject to a detailed objective criteria which is 
set out in our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy. 
8. 
How your money is protected 
8.1 
eToro Europe is covered by the Cyprus Investor Compensation Fund ("Fund"). If we fail, the Fund can 
return your money up to €20,000 or as may be updated from time to time. For more information about 
the Fund, visit our website at https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/regulation-license/ and 
https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/complaints/tae/.  
8.2 
Importantly, the Fund protection is only applicable to regulated products. This means that any 
cryptoasset trades, including cryptoasset copy trades, are not protected, but security trades and 
security copy trades, and CFD trades and CFD copy trades, are protected. 
9. 
How you can make a complaint 
9.1 
If you are unhappy with a Service or something has gone wrong, please contact us and we will try to 
put it right. You may contact us directly via:

PART 2 – HOW OUR SERVICES OPERATE 
11. 
Client classification 
11.1 
We will classify you as a retail client for the purposes of the Services. Retail clients are given the highest 
level of protection under Applicable Law. 
11.2 
You may request that we re-categorise you as a different type of client, but we would not be obliged 
to do this. If you are re-classified as a professional client, you may lose certain protections. In these 
circumstances, we will provide you with a Client Categorisation Notice, setting out the regulatory 
protections that you will keep, as well as those that you will lose. If a term of the Client Categorisation 
Notice conflicts with, or is different to, a term in this Agreement, the Client Categorisation Notice will 
apply. 
12. 
How to open, and maintain your eToro account 
Applying for an account 
12.1 
To apply for an eToro account, you will need to complete an online application form and provide us 
with information that we request, so that we can identify you, verify your identity, and conduct fraud 
checks, sanctions checks, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism checks, and any other checks 
as required by Applicable Law, including without limitation, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
("FATCA"), as required by our internal procedures. This means we will require you to provide us with 
personally identifiable information, the countries where you are a tax resident, confirmation of whether 
or not you are a US citizen or whether or not your place of birth is in the US or any other information 
which will be required under Applicable Law. 
12.2 
You will also need to provide us with information so we can assess whether the Trading Services are 
appropriate for you, and assess whether the Copy Trading Services are suitable for you. Please refer 
to clause 3 – "Regulatory status of our Services" for more information about the Appropriateness 
Assessments and the Suitability Assessments. 
12.3 
If you are applying for an eToro account on behalf of a business, you must have the authority to enter 
into agreements, including this Agreement, on behalf of that business. 
12.4 
If you have more than one eToro account, we may combine your eToro accounts into one. We may 
also place limits on the number of eToro accounts which you may hold, as well as the number of eToro 
accounts which one household may hold.  
12.5 
eToro Europe is a wholly owned subsidiary of eToro Group Limited, which is an unregulated company 
in the British Virgin Islands. If you open an eToro account but have not put money into the account or 
you are trading using a 'demo account', you will be a customer of eToro Group Limited. This means 
that you will not benefit from the protections available to clients of eToro Europe, which is a regulated 
entity, until the point in time when you fund your account.  
Linking a payment method 
12.6 
In order to put money into your eToro account, you will need to link your eToro account to a current 
account, debit card, credit card, electronic wallet or other means of payment, which is approved by us. 
We call this your payment method. We may allow you to link more than one payment method, but we 
are not required to do so. We may accept different payment methods in different countries. 
12.7 
The payment method must belong to you, and must be in your name. We do not accept money from 
people who are not you. We may require you to provide us with documents to verify the details, and 
the ownership of your payment method. If we cannot verify the details of your payment method, or if 
we cannot verify that the payment method belongs to you, you will not be able to deposit money into 
your eToro account, and therefore will not be able to use our Services. 
 
10 
 
12.8 
We may process your deposits and withdrawals, and reserve the right to use electronic wallets and 
payment processing accounts operated by an eToro Europe affiliate. To the extent permitted by 
Applicable Law, if you withdraw funds from your eToro account to another account operated by and 
eToro Group entity, including an electronic wallet (crypto, fiat or any other wallet), we may instruct the 
eToro Group entity to reverse the withdrawal (and return the money to the original account where it 
will be subject to these Terms and Conditions, including any set-off right), freeze, or block the relevant 
withdrawal(s) to the extent that we have indications that you have breached this Terms and Conditions, 
including any rules of trading (we explain our rules of trading in clause 23 - "Rules of trading") in our 
sole discretion. 
Provision of information 
12.9 
We may, from time to time, require additional information and/or documents (including as required by 
anti-money laundering regulations and any other similar regulations applicable to us ("AML"), as well 
as for anti-fraud measures or any other related internal procedures), or clarifications to information 
and/or documents which you have provided to us.  
12.10 
If any information which you have provided to us under this clause 12 – "How to open, and maintain 
your eToro account" changes, you should tell us, in writing, as soon as possible, and no later than 30 
days after the change takes place. 
12.11 
The information you provide to us must be complete, accurate and not misleading. If you do not provide 
us with the required information, or if you provide inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information, 
we will not be able to open an eToro account for you, or, if you already have an eToro account, we may 
freeze, block, or close your eToro account. 
13. 
Keeping your eToro account safe 
13.1 
If we accept your application, we will open an eToro account for you. You will need to choose a 
username and a password to access your eToro account and we may also require other security details.  
13.2 
It is your responsibility to take all reasonable steps to keep your eToro account safe. For example, you 
should keep your security details, such as your username and password, a secret. You should select a 
password that it is not easy to guess (such as using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, 
numbers and symbols) and is a unique password for your eToro account. We recommend that you do 
not re-use a password previously used by you for other platforms/services. You should also apply two-
factor authentication to your account to keep your account secure.  
13.3 
You will need to change your security details immediately and contact us as soon as possible if you 
think someone else knows them.  
13.4 
We may block access to your eToro account or block access to our Services if we believe that it is 
necessary for security or legal reasons. For example, if we think someone may have access to or is 
using your eToro account without your permission. 
13.5 
We may contact you to provide you with new security details, or contact you to require you to change 
your security details. 
13.6 
You must not give any third party (including minors) any access to and/or control of your eToro account. 
If you elect to give another person access to and/or control of your eToro account, you do so at your 
own risk and we will not be responsible for the decisions of that third party. For example, if they place 
trades or if they place copy trades and make a loss, we won't refund you that money. We reserve the 
right to cancel or reject any orders placed by any third party for security and/or legal reasons. 
14. 
How to pay money into, and take money out of, your eToro account 
Paying money in (also called "deposits") 
14.1 
You can pay money into your eToro account by using one of your payment methods (which we referred 
to in clause 12 – "How to open, and maintain your eToro account"). We do not accept cash or cheques. 
14.2 
If your payment method charges us a fee, for example, a payment transfer or a payment processing 
fee or currency conversion, we may charge you a "transfer fee". Our transfer fees are set out on our 
website. 
 
11 
 
14.3 
Your money will show in your eToro account as soon as we are satisfied that it comes from you. 
14.4 
We may place a limit on how much money you can pay into your eToro account. We will let you know 
in advance if we do this. 
14.5 
We may return any money which comes in from a payment method that is not in your name. If we are 
charged fees for returning your money, we will deduct an amount equal to that fee from the money 
which we are returning. 
Taking money out (also called "withdrawals") 
14.6 
You can take money out of your eToro account by sending it back to the payment method that it came 
in from, subject to any Applicable Law and any regulatory restrictions that may apply (including AML 
restrictions), which may prevent us from sending it to such payment method.. We may permit you to 
withdraw money to an alternative payment method also in your name, but only after we are satisfied 
that the alternative payment method belongs to you and is approved by us (subject to any Applicable 
Law and regulatory restrictions, including AML restrictions).  
14.7 
You may not be able to take money out of your eToro account if it would leave insufficient funds in 
your eToro account to pay for any unsettled transactions and/or applicable fees or charges.  
14.8 
To protect your money against fraud, we may put a limit on how much can be taken out of your eToro 
account. The minimum amount per withdrawal is set out on our website. However, if you are closing 
your eToro account in accordance with clause 26 – "Closing or blocking access to your eToro account", 
this restriction will not apply.  
14.9 
We may charge you a fee each time you take money out. Our fees are available on our website. 
14.10 
We will process a valid and complete withdrawal request by the end of the following business day. Our 
processing may be delayed or declined if required under Applicable Law, including if we have an AML 
concern. We may, or may not be able to, disclose to you the reasons for such delay or rejection. Please 
note that once your withdrawal request has been processed it might take a few days for your payment 
processor to update the balance in your account, depending on your payment processor's policy and 
procedures. 
14.11 
If you take money out of your eToro account after 11.00 am Eastern European Time, or on a non-
business day, we may not process your withdrawal request until the next business day. When we say 
business day, we mean Monday to Friday, but not a public or a bank holiday. 
Converting your money into US Dollars 
14.12 
Any money you pay into your eToro account must be made in British Pounds, Euros, US Dollars or 
another currency approved by us. We will convert all money into US Dollars.  
14.13 
Each time you take money out of your eToro account, we will convert the US Dollars into the currency 
selected by you, and we will charge you a fee. Our fees for converting money are available on our 
website. This clause does not apply if your withdrawal is in US Dollars. 
14.14 
You are responsible for the foreign currency exchange risk arising from any conversion of money to or 
from US Dollars in or out of your eToro account. 
15. 
How we treat your money 
15.1 
Subject to clause 16 – "When your money stops being client money", money that you put into your 
eToro account will be treated as "client money" in accordance with the CySEC rules.  
15.2 
The Services include trading in cryptoassets. Cryptoassets are not regulated products and therefore 
any money held in relation to a cryptoasset trade or copy trade will not be subject to the CySEC rules, 
unless otherwise stated. However, we will endeavour to protect your money in accordance with best 
market practice. 
 
12 
 
15.3 
Under the CySEC rules, we will separate client money from our own money by putting it into a separate 
bank account with a reputable bank. This is called a "client money account". We are permitted by 
the CySEC rules to hold your client money, and other clients' client money, together in the same client 
money account, this is called an "Omnibus Account". 
15.4 
We may hold client money in bank accounts in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We may also hold 
client money in bank accounts in a different country outside the EEA. This means that different rules, 
regulations and laws may apply to these banks, which means that in the event of an insolvency, money 
in a client money account held with that bank may be treated differently to money held with an EEA 
Bank. 
15.5 
We are not responsible for the insolvency, acts or omissions of any bank, although we will take 
reasonable care when choosing which bank to open a client money account with. 
15.6 
Unless we separately agree to do so with you, we will not pay you interest on any client money we 
hold, and if interest is accumulated on such funds, it shall not be deemed part of the clients' funds and 
shall not be credited to your account.  
15.7 
We may allow another third party to hold your money for the purpose of a transaction for you. Such 
third party may include an eToro Europe affiliate or a third party such as an exchange, or a clearing 
house, and may also hold your money in an Omnibus Account. If we do this, we will take reasonable 
steps to make sure your money is treated as client money where applicable but we will not be 
responsible for any acts or omissions of that third party. 
15.8 
In the event of the insolvency or any other analogous proceedings in relation to a third party which has 
been appointed to hold your client money, we will only have an unsecured claim against the party on 
behalf of you and our other clients. This means that you will be exposed to the risk that the money 
received by us from such party is insufficient to satisfy the claims of you and all other clients with 
claims in respect of the relevant account.  
Putting your money into a qualifying money market fund 
15.9 
Rather than holding your money in a client money account, we may put your money into units or shares 
in a qualifying money market fund. Your money will therefore not be held as client money in accordance 
with the applicable CySEC rules on safeguarding client funds, but the units or shares will be held as 
safe custody assets in accordance with applicable CySEC rules on safe custody. Under the CySEC rules, 
we will separate the units or shares in the qualifying money market fund from our own. 
15.10 
We will not pay you any interest earned on the units or shares in the qualifying money market fund. 
15.11 
Investments in qualifying money market funds are considered low risk. However, if the qualifying 
money market fund fails, which causes you to lose money, we may pay you back that money, although 
we are not required by Applicable Law to do this. 
15.12 
You expressly consent to us putting your money into a qualifying money market fund. Your agreement 
is a necessary condition for us to provide you with our Services. If you do not agree, or change your 
mind, please let us know in writing and we will help you close your eToro account. 
16. 
When your money stops being client money 
16.1 
We may use the money in your eToro account to pay fees, costs or charges which becomes due and 
payable. Where you enter into a transaction, all fees, costs, and charges for that transaction will 
become due and payable immediately upon execution, and therefore we will deduct the relevant sum 
from your eToro account at that point. Money which is due and payable will stop being treated as client 
money in accordance with Applicable Law. 
 
13 
 
16.2 
This term applies if you have been categorised as a "professional client" only: Following appropriate 
disclosure of the risks by us to you, you and we may separately agree that: (a) we will not hold money 
which you put into your eToro account in accordance with the client money rules and Applicable Law; 
and (b) such money will be transferred to us by way of full title and ownership, and free of any 
encumbrance, security interest, lien or other restriction, for the purpose of securing or covering your 
present, future, actual, contingent or prospective obligations to us (this is known as the "title transfer 
agreement"). Because title of the money has passed to us, you will no longer have a proprietary claim 
to that money and we can deal with it in our own right, and you will rank as a general creditor of ours. 
The title transfer agreement must be entered into using the eToro agreed format and signed by you, 
and may be provided to us by post, email, or via the eToro platform. 
16.3 
We may pay the money in your eToro account to a charity if you have not accessed your eToro account 
for 6 years. This means that we will stop treating your money as client money. We will try to contact 
you to return your money before we do this. If you contact us after the money has been given to a 
charity, we will pay it back to you. 
16.4 
If we transfer/sell our business to someone else, in accordance with the CySEC rules: 
(a) 
we will provide you with notice prior to the transfer; 
(b) 
they will hold your transferred money in accordance with the client money rules or, if they do 
not treat your money as client money, we will exercise due skill, care and diligence in assessing 
whether they will apply adequate measures to protect your money; and 
(c) 
you consent for us to transfer your money. If you do not want your money to be transferred to 
another person, please contact us and we can help you close your eToro account. 
17. 
Entering into transactions – Quotes 
17.1 
The eToro platform will display the indicative price to buy, and the price to sell for each product. This 
is called a "quote". A quote is not an offer by us to buy or sell any products. We generally do not 
provide quotes over the phone, but may do so at our discretion. 
17.2 
We are responsible for setting the price of instruments and products which can be traded on the eToro 
platform. This means that our quotes will be different from the prices provided by other brokers, the 
market price, as well as the current prices on any exchanges or trading platforms. 
17.3 
Although, when we provide a quote, we may take into account the price that we receive from a broker, 
the market, or any exchanges or trading platforms, we are under no obligation to do this, and we are 
under no obligation to ensure that the quotes which we provide are within any specific percentage of 
such price.  
17.4 
If the prices on a market, exchange or trading platform are distorted, for example during a short term 
price spike, or during pre-market, post-market, or intra-day auction periods, we may reflect similar 
prices in our quotes, but we are under no obligation to do this. 
17.5 
When the underlying market or exchange is closed, our quotes may reflect what we believe to be the 
current bid and ask price of the relevant product or, if you are trading a CFD, the underlying product, 
at that time, but we are under no obligation to do this.  
17.6 
Quotes are updated constantly which means that the price to buy or sell may change between the time 
that you place your order, and the time that we execute your order. We will tell you the price that your 
order was executed at.  
18. 
Entering into transactions – Placing an order 
18.1 
When you use our Trading Services or Copy Trading Services, you will place an order. An order is any 
request placed by you with us to purchase or to sell or otherwise deal in financial products, which may 
include a limit order, stop loss order and/or take profit order or such other order as may be available 
on the trading platform from time to time. We will then need to accept your order for it to take effect. 
Please read clause 19 – "Entering into transactions – Modifying your order, cancelling your order, or us 
not accepting your order" which explains when you might be able to change or cancel your order, as 
well as when we might not accept your order or cancel your order. 
 
14 
 
18.2 
In relation to stop loss orders specifically, you understand that we can change the stop loss rates which 
we will accept at our sole discretion (including in relation to open positions), and that we may give you 
very short notice of changes to stop loss rates or due to an Exceptional Event we may not be able to 
give you notice at all. We will exercise our right to change stop loss limits in accordance with Appliable 
Law. 
18.3 
You can place an order by using our platform. We generally do not accept orders over the phone, but 
may do so at our discretion. 
18.4 
We will execute orders that are received from your eToro account, and which we reasonably believe 
are from you, or authorised by you. Please be careful when making an order. If you place orders by 
accident or in error, for example if you place multiple orders which are the same, we will assume that 
you did this on purpose and we will execute them without checking this with you.  
18.5 
Once we accept your order, we will execute it in accordance with any specific instructions that you give. 
This is called a trade. The instructions which are available on our platform may change from time to 
time, but may include market orders, limit orders, take profits and stop losses. For more information 
on how you can place an order, the instructions that you can give, and how we may execute your order, 
please read our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy.  
18.6 
We cannot guarantee that your execution price will match your order price, including where you've 
placed a limit order, take profit and/or stop loss order. This is because the market may be volatile 
and/or the price may have moved up or down between the time that you place your order (or the time 
your limit order, take profit and/or stop loss order has been activated) and the time that we execute 
your order. This is known as slippage. When this happens, we will execute your order at the next best 
price and in accordance with our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy. 
18.7 
If you have placed an order during: 
(a) 
times in which the market of the underlying is suspended (for example, during the weekend or 
at off-market hours, suspension due to market conditions or due to any other event in which 
the market of the underlying is suspended), and/or 
(b) 
during the time the market was open, however, your order is triggered shortly following a 
suspension, 
then the applicable order you have placed will be executed as soon as is reasonable under the 
circumstances when trading resumes. We do not guarantee that your order will be executed at the first 
available underlying market price at commencement of trading or within any specific range compared 
to other market prices which may be available to you from other sources. We are not liable for any loss 
or for other claims which you may have in connection with such orders. 
18.8 
We will execute orders received during trading hours. Different products have different trading hours 
and these are available on our website. It is your responsibility to ensure you are aware of the trading 
hours for the product you are trading. We may agree to execute orders outside of business hours, at 
our discretion. 
18.9 
Where you place an order outside of market hours, or where the product you are trading has a 24/7 
market, but your order is placed during a period where there is limited trading (for example during the 
weekend), the availability of the different functionalities which we may provide as part of our Services, 
including instructions which you may give in respect of a trade, may be delayed or may not be available. 
We are not liable for any loss which results from your inability to access or provide certain trading 
functionalities and instructions. 
19. 
Entering into transactions – Modifying your order, cancelling your order, or us not accepting 
your order 
19.1 
You may request to cancel or modify an order which we have not executed. However, we cannot 
guarantee that we will be able to carry out your request. This will depend on the product that you are 
trading and whether you are using our Copy Trading Services. Please read the Schedule that applies to 
your order for more information about this. 
 
 
 
15 
 
19.2 
We are not required to accept every order that you make and reserve the rights to decline any order 
or transaction. If we have accepted your order we are not required to complete/execute every order. 
We provide below a non-exhaustive list of examples of situations where we may not accept an order, 
not execute or complete an order, or cancel an order: 
(a) 
if we reasonably believe the security of your eToro account is at risk, or if we're concerned 
about unauthorised or fraudulent use of your eToro account. This might happen if we think 
someone is using your eToro account without your permission; 
(b) 
if you do not have enough money in your eToro account to cover the maximum amount of loss 
associated with your order, plus any associated fees, charges and applicable margin;  
(c) 
if we reasonably believe that there is an error with your order. For example, if you have placed 
an order that is unusually large and you have never done this before;  
(d) 
if the order you have requested is unusual or for exaggerated volumes; 
(e) 
there is an error with the quote that we have provided. For example, if the quote is manifestly 
different to the market price, prices on exchanges, prices on trading platforms, and/or if the 
quote is clearly loss making; 
(f) 
there is a change in Applicable Law, which means that the order is no longer in compliance with 
Applicable Law; 
(g) 
there is a "Corporate Event" – please refer to the Schedule B – Investing in Securities, and 
Schedule C – Trading Cryptoassets for more information on Corporate Events; 
(h) 
an exchange requests or recommends that the order is cancelled; 
(i) 
you breach the rules of trading. We explain our rules of trading in clause 23 – "Rules of trading"; 
(j) 
an "Event of Default" occurs. We explain what an Event of Default is in clause 28 – "Event of 
Default"; and/or 
(k) 
an "Exceptional Event" occurs. We explain what an Exceptional Event is in clause 29 – 
"Exceptional Events".  
19.3 
We may, at our sole discretion, place limits on the minimum and/or maximum order sizes that we 
accept on our platform, as well as the number/volume of orders that we will accept from our clients or 
client's account 
19.4 
If we do not accept your order, complete/execute your order, or cancel your order, we will inform you 
by making that information available on our trading platform, unless there is a legal reason that we 
cannot provide this information to you. If we charged you a fee as part of the order, we will refund that 
money back into your eToro account. If there were no fees or charges, then you will not receive a 
refund. 
19.5 
If we have executed your order, and therefore a transaction has occurred, we may take corrective 
actions and either modify the transaction, or void the transaction, under the scenarios listed in clause 
19.2 above. We will inform you of errors by making information available on our trading platform, 
including any corrective actions we intend to take. 
19.6 
We will not be responsible for any losses you incur as a result of any actions or inactions taken by us 
in accordance with this clause 19 – "Entering into transactions – Modifying your order, cancelling your 
order, or us not accepting your order". 
20. 
Transactions records 
20.1 
Information about your trading activities, which includes records of the trades that you've concluded, 
your open positions, margin, cash balances as well as other information about your trades and orders, 
is available online in your eToro account (we call this the "Account Information"). Your eToro account 
will be updated no later than 24 hours after any activity takes place. You will be able to filter this 
information in different ways, for example on a per month basis. We are under no obligation to provide 
this information in hard copy or by email.  
 
16 
 
 
 
 
17 
 
20.2 
If you think there is a problem with your Account Information, please contact us as soon as possible 
and not later than 48 hours following the day on which the Account Information is posted. Otherwise, 
the Account Information will be conclusive evidence of your transactions, concluded trades, your open 
positions, margin, and cash balances. 
20.3 
We are required to keep your records, including the Account Information, for at least five years after 
your eToro account is closed. This period may be extended by Applicable Law or agreement between 
us in writing. These records will be our sole property.  
21. 
Fees and costs 
21.1 
We will charge you a fee for each order we execute for you. This is called a "spread". A spread is the 
difference in the sell and the buy price. The spread is different for each type of product and Service 
and can be found on our website. We will estimate the total amount of spread that applies each time 
you place an order. We cannot provide you with an exact amount because the spread may change 
between the time you make an order, and the time we execute your order. 
21.2 
The spreads which we charge can change due to market conditions. For example, there may be 
instances when market conditions cause spreads to widen beyond the typical spreads displayed on our 
website and/or platform. 
21.3 
We may charge you a fee when you put money in, or take money out of your eToro account, as detailed 
in clause 14 – "How to pay money into, and take money out of, your eToro account", and includes: 
(a) 
if you pay money into your eToro account and your payment method charges us a fee, for 
example a payment transfer or a payment processing fee, we may charge you a transfer fee; 
(b) 
if we return any money which comes in from a payment method that is not in your name and 
we are charged a fee for returning your money, we will deduct an amount equal to that fee 
from the money which we are returning; 
(c) 
if you withdraw money from your eToro account, we may charge you a fee; and 
(d) 
if we need to convert your money into US Dollars, we will charge you a fee. 
21.4 
We may also charge you a monthly inactivity fee, where there has been no trading activity on your 
eToro account for at least 12 months. Our inactivity fee is available on our website.  
21.5 
The above fees will apply to all of our Services. However, for specific Services, other fees may also 
apply. For example, if you trade CFDs, we may also charge you an overnight fee (please read Schedule 
A –Trading CFDs for more information). Additionally, if you trade cryptoassets, we may charge you a 
transfer fee, and/or a blockchain fee (please read Schedule C – Trading Cryptoassets for more 
information). 
21.6 
For more information of the commissions, charges, fees and costs that apply to our Services, please 
read the Schedule that applies to the Service that you use as well as our website at 
http://www.etoro.com/en/customer-service/fees/. We may update our commissions, charges, fees and 
costs from time to time. It is your responsibility to keep up to date with any changes, and to be aware 
of the commissions, charges, fees and costs that apply to your trades and the Services that you use. 
21.7 
You acknowledge that all amounts due to us shall be deducted from your eToro account balance.  
22. 
Recording your communication with us 
You agree that we may record any telephone, email and chat conversations with you, as well as any 
other forms of communications, activities, and transactions, between you and us, and that the 
recordings may be used as evidence in any proceedings relating to our Agreement with you, any order 
you place, and/or trades executed. These records will be our sole property. 
 
 
 
18 
 
23.

There are rules which you need to follow when using our Services. These are: 
(a)

short positions in the same or similar instruments at similar times either by you or by you acting

The eToro Community and information on the eToro platform 
24.1 
When you open an eToro account, you will have access to the "eToro Community", a place where 
eToro traders can share information with each other and with us. You will also have access to 
information which we make available on the eToro platform. 
Content which you post on the eToro Community 
24.2 
When you post content on the eToro Community you will need to follow the "Community Guidelines" 
which is available on our website. The Community Guidelines tell you the type of posts that are allowed 
and are not allowed. 
24.3 
In addition to the Community Guidelines: 
(a) 
you must make sure that all content you post belongs to you or that you have a right to post 
that information and that you do not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyright, 
contract rights or any other rights of any individual or make derogatory remarks regarding, 
defame or otherwise criticize any person or entity. You shall be liable for any damage resulting 
from any infringement or other violation of the copyright, trademarks or other proprietary rights 
of any individual or entity, and for any other harm or losses resulting from any content that 
you post; 
(b) 
you must not post any personal or security information about yourself, your eToro account, or 
about anyone else or their eToro account, and you must not try to obtain the personal or 
security information of someone else; 
(c) 
you must not provide investment advice, portfolio management services or any other type of 
service which requires you to be authorised by a regulator; 
 
19 
 
(d) 
you must not post that eToro Europe or anyone in the eToro Group endorse or warrant your 
content; 
(e) 
you must not advertise or promote another business or service, or any type of commercial 
content including spam; and 
(f) 
you must not post anything which is abusive, inciteful, defamatory, harassing, insulting, 
sexually explicit, offensive, racist, rude, hateful, threatening, violent, or illegal. 
24.4 
We may review and monitor your activity and posts on the eToro Community. If you breach any of the 
above rules or the Community Guidelines, we will record such breach and we will remove the post 
without telling you. We may also block your eToro account, or terminate our Agreement with you - we 
will tell you when we do this. We may also be required by Applicable Law to tell regulators or 
government authorities about a breach, and help them in any investigation about a breach. 
24.5 
By posting content on the eToro Community, you specifically grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, 
transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, copy, duplicate store, present 
and/or publish all or any part of your content, and we shall be free to use such content, in any manner 
or media whatsoever, on an unrestricted basis and without any attribution or royalties or other 
compensation to you, including without limitation, our website, advertisements, in printed media, and 
in newspapers. 
Content which we post, or which another trader posts, on the eToro Community or make available on 
the eToro platform 
24.6 
You should not make investment decisions based on information provided by individual traders (who 
may be anonymous or unidentifiable), such as details of the trades they make or any opinions 
expressed by them on the eToro platform. Content on eToro's social trading platform which is generated 
by members of the eToro Community does not contain advice or recommendations or endorsements 
by or on behalf of any eToro Group entity. 
24.7 
We may post information such as news, headlines, graphs, links to other websites, newsletters or 
information from other people, market prices for different products in real time or on a delayed basis, 
opening and closing market prices and ranges on third party exchanges, the highest and lowest market 
price on third party exchanges, the estimated and actual market volumes and the size, number and 
existence of current market bids and offers on a given day, on third party exchanges (we call this 
"Market Data").  
24.8 
Market Data may be produced by an exchange or another third party (for example information service 
providers which are not exchanges) which we pass on to you. In this scenario the Market Data belongs 
to the exchange or the third party (as applicable) and you agree to (a) comply with all the laws, rules 
and regulations applicable to access or using the Market Data; (b) using the Market Data only for your 
own trading purposes; and (c) cease any use of Market Data upon termination of this Agreement for 
any reason. We will enter into appropriate agreements with the relevant exchanges on your behalf 
relating to the proper use of your Market Data. 
24.9 
We, or the relevant exchanges, or the relevant third parties, which provide Market Data, do not 
guarantee that the Market Data we provide is always accurate, correct, or up to date although we will 
take reasonable steps to ensure that it is. Importantly, Market Data is not financial advice and we are 
not responsible or liable for any action which you take or do not take based on such Market Data. If 
you want to use the information to help you with your own investment decisions, you do this at your 
own risk. 
24.10 
You must not share information which we have posted outside of the eToro Community. In particular 
you should not redistribute the prices we make available to you to any other person whether such 
redistribution be for commercial or other purposes.

SCHEDULE A – TRADING CFDS 
This Schedule A sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when you trade CFDs on the eToro platform.  
In addition, the terms of Appendix 1 of this Schedule A will apply to you when you trade CFDs in relation to 
cryptoassets. The terms in this Schedule A (including Appendix 1 if applicable) apply to you in addition to the 
General Terms and Conditions, which apply to all of our services and not just to CFD trading. Capitalised words 
in this Schedule A will have the same meaning which are given to those word in the General Terms and Conditions. 
If a term of this Schedule A conflicts with or differs from a term in the General Terms and Conditions, this 
Schedule A will apply. 
 
1. 
What is CFD trading? 
A contract for difference ("CFD") is a financial product which allows you to trade on the price 
movements of an underlying product for example shares, forex, indices, commodities, or cryptoassets. 
When you trade a CFD, you are agreeing to exchange the difference in the price of an underlying 
product from the point in time when your position is opened to when it is closed.  
2. 
Our CFD trading service 
2.1 
We may act as principal or on a matched principal basis when providing you with the CFD Trading 
Services. This means we will be the counterparty to your trades. 
2.2 
Where you buy and sell complex products, such as CFDs, we are required to assess the appropriateness 
of the product by taking into account your trading knowledge and experience ("Appropriateness 
Assessment"). Please refer to clause 3 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on 
how we carry out the Appropriateness Assessment. 
2.3 
If we have assessed that our CFD trading service is not appropriate for you, we will either: 
(a) 
provide you with an appropriate warning, after which you may decide to continue at your own 
risk; or 
(b) 
block the CFD trading functionality on your account, so that you will not be able to trade CFDs 
on the eToro platform. 
2.4 
We allow you to trade CFDs using leverage. Trading with leverage means you can make money quickly, 
but you can also lose money quickly. You can find out more about what leverage is, the risks of trading 
CFDs, and the risks of leverage in paragraph 4 - "The key risks of CFD trading", paragraph 7 – "Using 
leverage and margin", the General Risk Disclosure, and on our website. 
2.5 
If you are a retail client, we will make sure that you do not lose more money than what you have 
deposited into your account when you trade CFDs, as required under any Applicable Law. This is called 
"negative balance protection". 
2.6 
Additionally, if you are a French resident, we will make sure that you do not lose more money than 
what you have deposited for a CFD trade, as required under any Applicable Law.  
3. 
Limitations to our CFD trading service 
When you trade a CFD, you will have an economic exposure to the underlying product of the CFD, but 
you will not have legal ownership of any underlying products. For example, if you trade a CFD over 
shares, you will not have the rights which legal owners have, such as voting rights or rights to dividends. 
However, we may carry out adjustments if a "Corporate Event" occurs. Please see paragraph 11 – 
"Corporate Events" below for more information. 
4. 
The key risks of CFD trading 
4.1 
CFDs are complex derivative products and come with a high risk of losing money quickly due to leverage 
(regardless of the underlying product). Trading with leverage magnifies your gains and losses, so small 
price changes in the underlying product can result in large losses or gains. It is therefore possible that 
you may lose more than your deposit in a trade. We provide more information on leverage in paragraph 
7 - "Using leverage and margin". 
 
30 
 
4.2 
The underlying assets of CFDs are often made up of equities, foreign exchange, commodities, 
cryptoassets and similar products. The markets of these products can be volatile, which means the 
prices of the products can change rapidly, and are therefore unpredictable. Trading CFDs in relation to 
cryptoassets may involve higher risk than trading CFDs in relation to other financial instruments. The 
additional risks associated with trading cryptoasset CFDs are set out in Appendix 1. 
4.3 
You should only trade CFDs if: 
(a) 
you have sufficient and relevant knowledge about or experience in, trading in volatile markets;  
(b) 
you fully understand how CFDs work (including all associated risks and costs), are aware that 
the use of margin or leverage creates greater risks;  
(c) 
you are trading with money you can afford to lose;  
(d) 
you have a high-risk tolerance;  
(e) 
you want to gain short term exposure to a product/market; 
(f) 
you understand that there are situations where we will be able to close out your transactions 
without giving you notice or by giving you very short notice;  
(g) 
you understand that we can change margin requirements at our sole discretion (including in 
relation to open positions), and that we may give you very short notice of changes to margin 
requirements or due to an Exceptional Event we may not be able to give you notice at all. We 
will exercise our right to change margin requirements in accordance with Appliable Law; 
(h) 
you understand that when margin requirements change, we cannot guarantee that your 
execution price will match your order price, including where you've placed a limit order, take 
profit and/or stop loss order; 
(i) 
you have time to manage your transactions on an active basis and understand that active 
management may be required at short notice: 
(i) 
due to the volatility of the underlying market, which will be increased as a result of 
leverage; 
(ii) 
as a result of us changing margin requirements, including for open positions (as stated 
above); and/or 
(iii) 
as a result of us giving you very short notice, or due to an Exceptional Event no notice 
at all, of changes to margin requirements (as stated above); 
(j) 
you are trading with money you can afford to lose;  
(k) 
you have a high-risk tolerance; and  
(l) 
you want to gain short term exposure to a product/market. 
4.4 
You should ensure you fully understand the risks involved before using our Services and, if required, 
take appropriate investment, financial, legal, tax and other necessary professional, independent advice. 
More information on the risks associated with trading CFDs is set out in our Risk Warning Disclosures. 
You should read this document and fully understand the risks before entering into this Agreement. 
4.5 
Please refer to clause 5 of the General Terms and Conditions, the General Risk Disclosure, our website 
for more information on the key risks of using our services. 
5. 
Best Execution 
We are bound to comply with our Best Execution and Order Handling Policy when executing your trades. 
Please refer to clause 6 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how we comply with 
our best execution obligations to you. 
 
 
 
31 
 
6. 
Conflicts of interest 
6.1 
We are required to act in your best interest when providing our services. However, there may be 
instances where your interest conflicts with our interests, or with another client's interest. For example, 
with respect to CFD trading: 
(a) 
we set both the sell price and the buy price of CFDs, both of which are quoted on our platform; 
and  
(b) 
when you enter into a CFD transaction, we may or may not purchase or sell the underlying 
product. If we buy the underlying product, we may have rights, for example voting rights if we 
are a shareholder, which we can exercise without notifying you.  
6.2 
Please refer to clause 7 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the conflicts of 
interest that may apply to our services. 
7. 
Using leverage and margin 
7.1 
We allow you to trade CFDs using leverage. Leverage is a form of borrowing which allows you to deposit 
only a part of the cost of your transaction upfront. This deposit is called "margin" and is used by us as 
security against any potential losses you may incur. The more leverage you use, the less margin you 
need. Money being used as margin cannot be taken out of your account. 
7.2 
Different amounts of leverage apply to different underlying products. Applicable Law sets maximum 
leverage amounts (and therefore the minimum margin requirement) that we can offer. However, we 
can decrease the leverage (and therefore increase the margin requirement) as well as change the 
leverage (and therefore change the margin requirement) we offer at any time, so long as the leverage 
does not exceed the maximum leverage amount, including with respect to open positions as stated in 
paragraph 4.3(g) above. The amount of leverage which you can access at a particular point in time can 
be viewed on our website.  
7.3 
If you are a retail client, we are required by law to limit the amount of leverage that you can apply to 
certain transactions and set a minimum margin requirement. Professional clients will not be subject to 
these restrictions. The nature of these restrictions will depend on where you are resident, and are likely 
to vary depending on the underlying asset that you are trading. Where transactions were executed 
with a leverage or margin that is no longer permitted in the country where you live, we may close any 
or all of your open positions without further notice to you and we may also close your eToro account. 
This may result in a profit or a loss to you.  
7.4 
We will calculate your margin on a position by position basis. The money available as margin on a 
position, cannot equal less than 50% of the money that you might lose on that open position at any 
time. Where you do not have enough margin available, we may require additional margin to secure 
your trades. The amount of money that you must have available as a margin can be viewed on our 
website. 
7.5 
It is your responsibility to monitor the money in your account against your potential losses, the margin 
required, and whether your position is close to your stop level, as we will not notify you when this 
happens. If you do not have enough money in your eToro account to meet the margin requirement on 
a certain position, you should:  
(a) 
close your open position to stop you losing more money;  
(b) 
partially close your positions; and/or 
(c) 
adjust your stop levels. The ability to adjust your stop levels is subject to you having the 
appropriate funds in your account.  
7.6 
Unless you carry out one or more of the above steps, your trade will be closed irrespective of the total 
money available in your eToro account or the performance and balance of your other open positions.  
Your trade will be closed without prior notice to you and without an opportunity for you to choose the 
timing of liquidation. We may but are not obligated to, in our sole discretion, allow you to add funds 
into the position to avoid any forced liquidation of your cryptoassets.  
 
32 
 
7.7 
We may change our margin requirements and leverage ratio as detailed in paragraphs 4.3(g) and 7.2. 
One margin demand does not preclude another. Any amount needed to meet the new requirements 
must be satisfied in the currency we specify. The adjustment should be made immediately unless we 
specify a future date and/or time by which the adjustment must be made. 
8. 
Placing an order 
Please refer to clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how you may place 
an order and provide trading instructions on the eToro platform. 
9. 
Closing your orders automatically 
9.1 
We may close your orders where you have placed a stop loss on your CFD trade, and the stop price 
has been reached.  
9.2 
We may close your orders and trades where you do not have the required margin in your account or 
you do not meet the margin requirements, as described in paragraph 7.1 above. We may do this 
without further notice to you, and you may make a profit or a loss as a result. 
9.3 
We may also close your orders in special circumstances, as described in paragraph 11 – "Corporate 
Events" below, as well as due to an Exceptional Event, as defined in clause 29 of the General Terms 
and Conditions. 
9.4 
Please also refer to clause 19 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on other situations 
in which we may close your orders. 
10. 
Fees and costs 
10.1 
Please refer to clause 21 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on the fees and costs 
which apply to all transactions on the eToro platform. 
10.2 
As detailed on our website and in clause 21 of the General Terms and Conditions, where you trade 
CFDs, we will charge or credit your account with an overnight fee/credit each time you keep a position 
open after trading hours, including on public and bank holidays. If you keep your position over the 
weekend, we will charge/credit you for three nights for positions carried over. The overnight fee/credit 
will be taken/added out of the available balance in your eToro account. How the overnight fee/credit is 
calculated will be different depending on your underlying product, the amount of leverage being utilised, 
and whether you are entering into a buy or a sell trade. Our overnight fees/credits are subject to 
change and can be viewed on our website, and the overnight fee relevant to your order will also be 
displayed to you when you open a position and on our fees page. 
11. 
Corporate Events 
11.1 
A "Corporate Event" is something which will result in a change to one or more financial instruments. 
Examples of Corporate Events include, but are not limited to, share consolidations, share splits, 
reorganisations, mergers, take-over offers (and similar), name changes and rebranding, dividend 
distributions, insolvency, delistings and changes to Applicable Law or regulation.  
11.2 
If a Corporate Event impacts the underlying product of a CFD in your eToro account, we will use 
reasonable endeavours to adjust the open positions on that CFD, in a fair way and in accordance with 
market practice, and/or taking into account the treatment we may receive from our counterparties or 
any relevant third party and the deduction of any taxes applicable. The adjustments we carry out will 
depend on the circumstances of each event, and is according to our sole discretion, however we are 
not obliged to do this. Adjustments may include changing the price or the quantity of CFDs that you 
have in your account to reflect the economic rights that you had prior to the Corporate Event occurring. 
11.3 
Notwithstanding paragraph 11.2 above, we reserve the right to close any open CFD positions where 
the underlying product is impacted by a Corporate Event (including delistings and insolvency) in a fair 
way and taking into account the treatment we may receive from our counterparties and/or any relevant 
third party. In this respect we may make any required adjustment (price, quantity or any other 
adjustment) resulting from the Corporate Event as may be applicable. We may close your open 
positions prior to or following such Corporate Events, at our sole discretion. 
 
33 
 
11.4 
Please refer to Part 3 of the Terms and Conditions for more information about our rights and your rights 
in special circumstances.

Appendix 1 
Trading CFDs in relation to Cryptoassets 
1. 
The cryptoasset CFD trading service 
1.1 
Our services may allow you to trade CFDs in relation to cryptoassets using leverage which is subject to 
the terms of Schedule A and this Appendix 1. Our services may also allow you to trade cryptoassets 
using leverage which is subject to the terms of Schedule C instead. 
1.2 
If the transaction you enter into is a CFD in relation to cryptoassets, this will be specified on the 
transaction platform and/or your account statement.  
2. 
The key risks of trading cryptoasset CFDs 
2.1 
In addition to the key risks of trading CFDs as set out in paragraph 4 of Schedule A, the below key 
risks apply in relation to trading cryptoassets CFDs. 
2.2 
As stated in paragraph 4 of Schedule A, CFDs are complex derivative products and come with a high 
risk of losing money quickly due to leverage (regardless of the underlying product). Cryptoassets are 
volatile products, which means the prices of the products can change rapidly, and are therefore 
unpredictable. The price fluctuation of cryptoassets, in combination with the use of leverage, means 
that your trades in cryptoasset CFDs may significantly increase or decrease in value at any given 
moment, and this may result in a loss of all the capital you have invested in such cryptoasset CFD 
transaction. Therefore, cryptoasset CFDs come with an even higher risk of losing money. 
2.3 
As stated at paragraph 4 of Schedule A, you should only trade CFDs if you have sufficient time to 
manage your transactions on an active basis. This is even more important when trading cryptoasset 
CFDs, due to the volatility of the underlying cryptoassets, in combination with the use of leverage. If 
the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by us to provide a substantial amount 
of additional margin funds, without notice or on very short notice, in order to maintain your position. 
If you do not provide the required funds within the time required by us, your position may be liquidated 
at a loss. 
2.4 
Other important risks when trading cryptoassets CFDs are: 
(a) 
particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the 
marketplace for any cryptoassets, the actual market rate at which a market order or trade for 
a cryptoasset CFD is executed may be different from the prevailing rate indicated via the CFD 
trading services at the time of your order or trade; 
(b) 
the actual market rate at which a market order or trade for a cryptoasset CFD is executed may 
be different from the rate that is displayed on the eToro platform at the time that you make 
your order, if prices are fluctuating substantially; 
(c) 
cryptoassets are a unique kind of product, backed by technology and trust, unlike most 
currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such 
as gold or silver. This means there is no central bank that can take corrective measure to 
protect the value of cryptoassets, and therefore the value of cryptoasset CFDs; 
2.5 
as cryptoassets are virtual products, they may become 'delisted' or unsupported at any time, which 
means they may no longer be offered for sale or exchange on markets. If this happens, the CFDs which 
reference those delisted cryptoassets may become worthless. Please refer to paragraph 3 – "Our rights 
and your rights in special circumstances. 
(a) 
Our rights and your rights in special circumstances" for further information on how we 
may treat positions in such events; and 
 
35 
 
(b) 
cryptoassets are operated by underlying software protocols. We do not own or control the 
software underlying the cryptoassets in respect of which cryptoasset CFDs are available for 
trading on our platform. In general, the underlying software protocols are 'open source', which 
means anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. The underlying protocols which 
govern cryptoassets are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, known as "Forks". Forks 
can materially affect the way in which cryptoassets are value, and therefore the way in which 
CFDs which reference those cryptoasset are valued, and can create extreme price volatility. We 
explain your rights and our rights if a fork occurs in more detail in paragraph 3 – " Our rights 
and your rights in special circumstances". 
2.6 
You should carefully consider whether trading cryptoasset CFDs is suitable for you, in light of your 
financial circumstances.  You should ensure that you fully understand how cryptoassets and CFDs work 
(including all associated risks and costs), and are aware that the use of margin or leverage when 
trading CFDs in relation to cryptoassets creates even greater risks than the use of margin or leverage 
when trading CFDs in relation to other underlying products. 
3. 
Our rights and your rights in special circumstances 
3.1 
We reserve the right to close any open cryptoasset CFD positions, in a fair way and taking into account 
the treatment we may receive from our counterparties and/or any relevant third party, where the 
underlying cryptoasset is impacted by any of the following events: 
(a) 
if the underlying cryptoasset is delisted, removed and/or cancelled from any of the exchanges 
on which it is listed;  
(b) 
if we reasonably become aware that the underlying cryptoasset is likely to be delisted, removed 
and/or cancelled from any of the exchanges on which it is listed;  
(c) 
if you do not have the required margin in your account or you do not meet the margin 
requirements. Please refer to paragraphs 7.6, 7.7, and 9.2 of Schedule A; 
(d) 
we no longer support the trading in such underlying cryptoasset for any reason;  
(e) 
an Exceptional Event has occurred, as defined in clause 29 of the General Terms and Conditions; 
and/or 
(f) 
a Fork has occurred in relation to the underlying cryptoasset.  
3.2 
If you have placed a cryptoasset CFD order when the market of the underlying cryptoasset is suspended, 
and/or when the market was open, however, your order is triggered shortly following a suspension, 
then we will execute the applicable order as soon as is reasonable under the circumstances when 
trading resumes. We do not guarantee that your order will be executed at the first available underlying 
market price at commencement of trading or within any specific range compared to other market prices 
which may be available to you from other sources. We are not liable for any loss or for other claims 
which you may have in connection with such orders. 
3.3 
When trading cryptoasset CFDs, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the 
operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality, security, 
reliability or availability. You also acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility or liability in 
respect of an unsupported branch of a forked cryptoasset. 
3.4 
When a Fork occurs, there may be substantial price volatility around the event, and we may temporarily 
suspend trading of CFDs which reference the forked cryptoasset on the eToro platforms (with or without 
advance notice to you). We may then, at our discretion:  
(a) 
configure or reconfigure its systems;  
(b) 
determine which of the forked cryptoassets has the majority consensus behind it and offer an 
alternative cryptoasset CFD on our trading platform; and/or  
(c) 
decide not to support (or cease supporting) the impacted cryptoasset CFD entirely. 
 
36 
 
3.5 
In the event that a situation arises that is not covered under Schedule A, or the General Terms and 
Conditions, we will resolve the matter on the basis of good faith and fairness and, where appropriate, 
by taking such action as is consistent with market practice. 
3.6 
Please refer to Part 3 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information about our rights and 
your rights in special circumstances across all our services.  
 
 
 
37 
 
SCHEDULE B – INVESTING IN SECURITIES 
This Schedule B sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when you invest in securities on the eToro 
platform. The terms in this Schedule B apply to you in addition to the General Terms and Conditions, which 
apply to all of our services and not just securities trading. Capitalised words in this Schedule B will have the 
same meaning which are given to those word in the General Terms and Conditions. If a term of this Schedule B 
conflicts with or differs from a term in the General Terms and Conditions, this Schedule B will apply. 
1. 
Our securities trading service 
1.1 
You can buy and sell shares and units in exchanged traded funds ("ETFs") on our platform, as well as 
other securities that we may offer from time to time. 
1.2 
We may act as principal or on a matched principal basis when providing you with the securities trading 
services. This means we will be the counterparty to your trades. 
1.3 
This Schedule only applies to buy transactions made without leverage, including trades made in 
accordance with our copy trading service (both CopyTrader and CopyPortfolio transactions) which are 
indicated as such on the trading platform. Therefore, our security trading services are differentiated 
depending on type of position you enter into, which country you reside in, and the market where the 
security is traded. As a result, some particular types of trade involving securities may not be carried 
out through our securities trading service and will instead be carried out as CFD trades. We have 
included a full list of these trades and what alternative service will be used at Appendix 1 to this 
Schedule B. Your account statement will include an indication of the type of transaction. 
1.4 
Where you buy and sell non-complex products, for example, shares, we are not required to assess the 
appropriateness of the product or service that we provide to you and in such case, you will not benefit 
from the protection of the CySEC rules on assessing appropriateness. 
1.5 
Securities such as shares are held in custody. Please see paragraph 9 – "Custody" below for more 
information.  
1.6 
We may be required to give your details (including your email address) and details of your shareholding 
to the company registrars. By trading securities on our platform, you consent to us providing your 
identifying information to any requesting service provider of the company. 
2. 
Limitations to our securities trading service 
2.1 
We may provide factual market information and information in relation to any securities at your request. 
However, we are not obliged to disclose such information to you and, if we do supply this information, 
it does not constitute investment advice. 
2.2 
We will not be liable to you for any act or omission of any such third-party including but not limited to 
information provided by such third-party, except where we have acted negligently, fraudulently or in 
wilful default in relation to the appointment of the third-party. 
2.3 
The eToro trading platform is not an exchange or a market. This means that you can only enter into 
trades and investments with us on the platform, and not third parties. Therefore, our services are 
limited to you buying a security on our platform, and selling that security on our platform. You will not 
be able to transfer the securities out of your eToro account, including for the purposes of selling that 
security on another platform or to another person. 
2.4 
We do not permit "US persons" (as defined by the Internal Revenue Service "IRS") to invest in 
securities on our platform. If we allow you to trade in securities and then identify you as a US person, 
we may close any open positions you may hold and then block or close your eToro account. We may 
also be required to deduct US withholding tax on income and gross proceeds from your investments in 
listed US securities on our platform. 
2.5 
If you are not a US person, we will ask you to sign a W-8BEN form before we accept an order from you 
to invest in shares which are listed in the US. If you have not previously provided us with a valid W-
8BEN, and you already hold US shares, we will ask you to complete a W-8BEN. If you do not return the 
signed and completed W-8BEN form before the date we specify, we reserve the right to sell your US 
shares. You have an ongoing obligation to inform us if you are no longer eligible for W-8BEN status. 
 
38 
 
2.6 
We will apply the default rate of taxes applied by the relevant tax authorities.  
3. 
The key risks of securities trading 
3.1 
All financial products carry risk, and even trading non-complex products, such as securities, will have 
a degree of uncertainty. The securities markets can be volatile, which means the prices of the securities 
can change rapidly, and therefore are unpredictable, which means that securities dealing is not suitable 
for everyone. 
3.2 
You should ensure you fully understand the risks involved before using our Services and if required 
take appropriate investment, financial, legal, tax and other necessary professional, independent advice. 
More information on the risks associated with trading CFDs is set out in our Risk Warning Disclosures. 
You should read this document and fully understand the risks before entering into this Agreement. 
3.3 
Please refer to clause 5 of the General Terms and Conditions, the General Risk Disclosure, and our 
website for more information on the key risks of using our services. 
4. 
Best Execution 
Please refer to clause 6 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how we comply with 
our best execution obligations to you. 
5. 
Conflicts of interest 
Please refer to clause 7 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how we manage 
conflicts of interest that may apply to our services. 
6. 
Placing an order 
6.1 
Please refer to clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how you may place 
an order and provide trading instructions on the eToro platform. 
6.2 
We execute your orders as soon as reasonably practicable, but sometimes there will be a delay between 
when we receive your order and when we are able to execute it. Where a delay occurs, there may be 
a difference between the market price of the securities that you were quoted and the market price on 
the exchange, which may or may not be to your benefit. The exchange is not required to accept your 
order, and is not required to execute your order at the price that you were quoted. 
6.3 
Each order that you make is binding on you even where you have exceeded any limit on our platform, 
and you must pay any sums due on any transaction immediately once the transaction has been entered 
into. 
6.4 
You are responsible for monitoring your orders until they are confirmed or cancelled, as we may not 
provide you with explicit written notification. You should contact us immediately if you are unsure about 
the status of an order. 
7. 
Fees and costs 
7.1 
Please refer to clause 21 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on the fees and costs 
which apply to all transactions on the eToro platform. 
7.2 
We may charge you for the provision by us to you of Market Data which relates to securities. 
7.3 
Additional charges may also be incurred by you in the case of delayed or failed settlement of a 
transaction. Any such amounts will be your responsibility and, where appropriate, will be deducted 
from your account. 
8. 
Settlement 
8.1 
Your security investments will settle in accordance with local markets. This is generally on a T+2 basis.  
 
39 
 
8.2 
If you invest in a security, the consideration for the transaction and all applicable fees, charges and 
taxes for that transaction will be deducted from your account at the time of execution of the transaction. 
The security will be available for sale on your account prior to settlement of the transaction and your 
account will reflect this. Should the transaction fail to settle, we may reverse the transaction, return 
any fees, charges and taxes for that transaction and amend your account to reflect the same. 
8.3 
In the event of our insolvency, you may not have title to the securities that you have bought on the 
eToro platform, where settlement has not yet occurred. This is the case even if the securities which 
you have bought are shown as available in your eToro account. In these circumstances, you will be 
entitled to the amount that you paid for the securities, which will form part of your client money. Please 
refer to clause 15 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on client money. 
8.4 
We are not liable for any losses, costs or expenses that you suffer as a result of any delay or change 
in market conditions either before we execute an order or before a transaction settles. 
9. 
Custody 
9.1 
You instruct us to arrange for any securities which you have bought on our platform to be held on your 
behalf until we receive further instruction from you to sell that security. This is called "custody", and 
means that we will be your "custodian". We will hold the securities on your behalf in accordance with 
the Applicable Law, or may arrange for the custody services to be provided by another company (this 
is called a "sub-custodian"). We are not liable for any acts, omissions, insolvency or dissolution of the 
sub-custodian, unless any losses which you incur have been caused by our fraud, wilful default or gross 
negligence. 
9.2 
When holding such securities on your behalf, we take measures to ensure their protection and for 
safeguarding your ownership rights, including: 
(a) 
keeping records and accounts enabling us at any time and without delay to distinguish assets 
held for you from assets held for any other client and from our own assets; 
(b) 
maintaining our records and accounts in a way that ensures their accuracy and, in particular 
their correspondence to the securities held for you; 
(c) 
conducting, on a regular basis, reconciliations between our internal accounts and records and 
those of sub-custodians; and 
(d) 
taking steps to ensure that any securities deposited with a sub-custodian are identifiable 
separately from any of our assets or any of the sub-custodian's assets. 
9.3 
Detailed records of all your securities held by the custodian or sub-custodian will be kept by us at all 
times to show that your securities are held on your behalf, for your benefit and do not belong to the 
custodian or any sub-custodian. 
9.4 
We exercise all due skill, care and diligence during the selection, appointment and periodic monitoring 
of the sub-custodian and over the arrangements for the holding and safeguarding of the securities. 
9.5 
Where your securities are deposited for safekeeping with a sub-custodian, there may be instances, if 
this is required by the law of the country where the securities are held, that the sub-custodian may 
have a security interest, lien or right of set-off over your securities enabling such sub-custodian to 
dispose of your securities, in order to recover debts that do not relate to you or the provision of services 
to you. 
9.6 
Your securities will be pooled together with our other clients' securities (we call this an "Omnibus 
Account") with a third party depositary in the name of eToro Europe on behalf of our clients. In such 
case, it may not be possible to separate your securities from those of other clients.  
9.7 
In the event of the insolvency or any other analogous proceedings in relation to that third party, we 
may only have an unsecured claim against the third party on behalf of the client, and the client will be 
exposed to the risk that the money received by us from the third party is insufficient to satisfy the 
claims of the client with claims in respect of the relevant account. We do not accept any liability or 
responsibility for any resulting losses. 
 
40 
 
9.8 
This also means that if we or our third-party nominee becomes insolvent, your securities may not be 
immediately identifiable by separate certificates, physical documents, or equivalent electronic entries 
on the register. Instead any claim will be against the Omnibus Account, and therefore more time might 
be needed for us to identify which securities are yours, and which belong to a different client. As 
additional time might be needed, this might increase your risk of losing money. In addition, if there is 
an unreconciled shortfall caused by the default of a custodian, you may share proportionately in that 
shortfall. 
9.9 
You agree that because of the nature of Applicable Laws or market practices in overseas jurisdictions, 
it may be in your best interest for your securities to be registered or recorded in our name or in the 
name of the sub-custodian, the nominee or any applicable delegate. If it is not possible for us to do 
this, then: 
(a) 
your securities may be registered or recorded in the name of the company/issuer, sub-
custodian, the nominee or any applicable delegate as the case may be; 
(b) 
your securities may not be segregated and separately identifiable from the securities of the 
company/issuer, sub-custodian, the nominee or any applicable delegate; and 
(c) 
as a consequence, in the event of a failure, your securities may not be as well protected from 
claims made on behalf of our general creditors. You should note that when we arrange for a 
third-party to hold your securities overseas there may be different legal and regulatory 
requirements than those applied in the Republic of Cyprus. 
9.10 
You agree that you will not try to sell, mortgage or otherwise deal in or part with the securities which 
we hold for you. 
9.11 
If you have not instructed us about the securities in your eToro account (e.g. to sell the securities) and 
we are unable to trace you despite having taken reasonable steps to do so we will stop treating your 
securities as client assets after a prescribed period of time, in accordance with Applicable Law. We will 
try to contact you before we do this. 
10. 
Corporate Events 
10.1 
A "Corporate Event" is something which will result in a change to one or more financial instruments. 
Examples of Corporate Events include, but are not limited to, share consolidations, share splits, 
reorganisations, mergers, take-over offers (and similar), name changes and rebranding, dividend 
distributions, insolvency, delistings and changes to Applicable Law or regulation. 
10.2 
If a Corporate Event impacts a security in your eToro account, we will use reasonable endeavours to 
adjust the securities in your account in a way that is fair and which aligns with market practice, 
depending on the circumstances of each event and according to our sole discretion, although we are 
not obliged to do this. Adjustments may include changing the price or quantity of securities in your 
account, to reflect the economic equivalent of such rights.  
10.3 
Notwithstanding paragraph 10.2, we reserve the right to close out any open positions impacted by a 
Corporate Event (including delistings and insolvency) in a fair way and taking into account the 
treatment we may receive from our counterparty and/or any relevant third party. In this respect we 
may make any required adjustment (price, quantity or any other adjustment) resulting from the 
Corporate Event as may be applicable. We may close out open positions prior to or following such 
Corporate Events, at our sole discretion. 
10.4 
Actions taken by us to adjust the securities in your account after a Corporate Event may create tax 
liabilities for you. We may deduct tax when making adjustments, however it will be your responsibility 
to satisfy these liabilities if we did not make such deduction. We may claim or reclaim tax credits on 
dividends or other income on securities. 
10.5 
If you are holding securities, such as shares, which grant you the right to receive a dividend or interest 
payment from a company, provided that you have held such shares prior to and on the relevant ex-
dividend date, we will pay this money into your eToro account on receipt by us. We may deduct from 
this payment any applicable tax however it will be your responsibility to satisfy these liabilities if we 
did not make such deduction.  
 
41 
 
10.6 
If the underlying market on which your security is traded is suspended, you will not be able to place 
any sell orders on those securities, and we will not be able to execute any sell orders which you have 
already placed on those securities until the market recommences trading. We cannot guarantee that 
your order will be executed immediately when the market recommences trading, and we may be 
required to wait until there is enough demand to buy your security. 
10.7 
Where a Corporate Event results in a fractional entitlement to part of a security, we will use reasonable 
endeavours to aggregate those fractional entitlements, and sell those fractional securities and credit 
your account with a cash value which may be subject to certain fees and charges. However, we are not 
obliged to do this. 
10.8 
Where a Corporate Event, such as partial redemptions, affect some but not all products held in an 
Omnibus Account, we will use reasonable endeavours to allocate the products which are affected to 
relevant clients in a fair way and in accordance with market practice. However, we are not obliged to 
do this. 
10.9 
We are not obliged to notify you of or arrange attendance at any annual general meetings or 
extraordinary general meetings applicable to your securities, and/or arrange the exercise of any voting 
rights attaching to securities we hold on your behalf, whether exercisable at an annual general meeting 
or otherwise. We do not enable participation in general meetings or the exercise of any voting rights 
attaching to securities we hold on your behalf. We are also not obliged to inform you of any class action 
or group litigation that is being proposed or taken concerning securities that we are holing on your 
behalf. We will never take discretionary action to vote securities which we hold on your behalf 
irrespective as to whether we are able to facilitate your voting of such securities. 
10.10 
Where Corporate Events affect some but not all securities held in a pooled account, we shall allocate 
the securities which are affected to relevant clients in a fair and equitable manner as we reasonably 
consider is appropriate.  
10.11 
As we will hold your securities in one or more pooled accounts, you may receive dividends or 
distributions net of applicable taxes which has been paid or withheld at rates that are less beneficial 
than those that might apply if the securities were held in your own name or not pooled. 
10.12 
Please refer to Part 3 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information about our rights and 
your rights in special circumstances.  
11. 
Effect of termination 
11.1 
Where you terminate your relationship with us and provide us with instructions for closing your account, 
we will arrange for your securities to be sold as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with this 
Schedule B and the General Terms and Conditions of your account and registration with us. We will 
hold the proceeds of the sale as client money an account in your name. 
11.2 
We will charge fees and any other applicable charges and taxes on the sale of your securities. 
11.3 
Where securities are sold, you may suffer a shortfall between the amount you invested and the amount 
you get back after sale. We are not responsible for any shortfall that arises. Any shortfall will be borne 
by you. 
12. 
We may lend your securities 
You acknowledge, accept, and expressly consent to us lending any securities held on your behalf to 
any third party. If we receive income or benefits (including stock lending fees and interest on posted 
collateral), we are not obliged to pass on such income or benefits to you. Where we lend out your 
securities, this may limit your ability to exercise voting rights (if any) relating to that security. Such 
lending to the extent conducted, will be offered in accordance with any Applicable Laws.      
 
 
 
42 
 
Appendix 1 
Situations in which Securities Trading Services are Differentiated 
 
Without derogating from the generality of paragraph 1.3 above, even though your transaction may relate to 
securities, we do not execute the following transactions, through our securities trading service:  
(a) 
securities buy transactions carried out using leverage;  
(b) 
all short transactions;  
(c) 
all transactions (including CopyTrader and CopyPortfolio transactions) made by users from 
certain countries (as a result of any liquidity restriction or regulatory restriction or any other 
reason as shall be determined by us in our sole discretion), as shall be amended from time to 
time at our sole discretion. Such transactions will be indicated in the trading platform and your 
account statement as CFD transactions;  
(d) 
all transactions in securities which are listed and traded on certain exchanges, as be determined 
by eToro at our sole discretion. Such transactions will be indicated in the trading platform and 
your account statement as CFD transactions;  
(e) 
transactions in specific securities, as shall be determined by eToro us at its our sole discretion. 
Such transactions will be indicated on the trading platform and your account statement as CFD 
transactions;  
(f) 
copy trading (including both CopyTrader and CopyPortfolio transactions) in securities that are 
classified as CFDs in the account of the copied investor, including any change in such 
classification from the underlying securities; and 
(g) 
other transactions that we are unable to execute as securities transactions or which are not 
executed as securities transactions according to our sole discretion. Such transactions will be 
indicated on the trading platform and your account statement as CFD transactions. 
In these circumstances, we will execute the trade as a CFD transaction, rather than a security 
investment. Therefore, your trade will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions and by 
Schedule A – Trading CFDs, and not by this Schedule B – Investing in Securities. 
 
 
 
43 
 
SCHEDULE C – TRADING CRYPTOASSETS 
This Schedule C sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when trading cryptoassets on the eToro platform. 
The terms in this Schedule C apply to you in addition to the General Terms and Conditions, which apply to all 
of our services and not just cryptoasset trading. Capitalised words in this Schedule C will have the same meaning 
which are given to those word in the General Terms and Conditions. If a term of this Schedule C conflicts with 
or differs from a term in the General Terms and Conditions, this Schedule C will apply. 
1. 
Our cryptoassets trading service 
1.1 
A "cryptoasset" is a type of decentralised digital currency or asset which is not issued by any central 
bank or issuer. Technological encryption techniques are used to produce units of the currency or asset 
and verify the transfer of units between owners of the cryptoasset. 
1.2 
We will act as your agent for your cryptoasset trades. This means that we will instruct a trade to be 
entered into with an executing broker on your behalf. The executing broker may be a third party entity 
or an eToro affiliate or Group entity. 
1.3 
The cryptoassets that we offer for trading may change from time to time. To view what cryptoassets 
are 
offered 
on 
our 
Trading 
platform, 
visit 
our 
website 
at 
https://www.etoro.com/discover/markets/cryptoassets.  
1.4 
Our cryptoasset services are differentiated depending on the type of position you enter into, your 
country of residence and the date on which you entered into your position. As a result, some of your 
trades, including historical open trades, in cryptoassets may not be carried out through our cryptoasset 
trading service and will instead be carried out as CFD trades. If the transaction you enter into is a 
cryptoasset CFD, this will be specified on the transaction platform and/or your account statement. We 
have included a full list of these trades and what alternative service will be used at Appendix 1 to this 
Schedule C.   
2. 
Investor protection and compensation 
2.1 
Since cryptoassets markets are decentralised and non-regulated, our cryptoassets trading service is an 
unregulated service which is not governed by certain European regulatory frameworks. This means 
that there is no central bank that can issue more currency or take corrective measures to protect the 
value of cryptoassets in a crisis. 
2.2 
As cryptoassets are unregulated, when you use our cryptoassets trading service you will not benefit 
from the protections available to clients receiving regulated investment services. For example, you will 
not have access to the Investor Compensation Fund for Customers of Cypriot Investment Firms ("Fund") 
or the Financial Ombudsman of the Republic of Cyprus for dispute resolution. 
2.3 
We will endeavour to enable you to benefit from rules relating to best execution and safekeeping of 
client assets to the extent required by applicable rules. 
2.4 
As part of the cryptoassets trading service, we may rely on third party service providers (including 
affiliated companies) to buy or hold the cryptoassets on your behalf. Those third parties may be based 
outside of the EEA and/or may be unregulated.  
3. 
Limitations to our cryptoassets trading service 
3.1 
The eToro trading platform is not an exchange or a market. This means that you can only enter into 
cryptoasset trades with us on the platform, and not with third parties. You will also not have the right 
to vote, stake (unless otherwise stated by us in accordance with paragraph 10 – "Staking"), or 
otherwise participate in any events or actions that may occur in relation to the cryptoasset. Therefore, 
our services are limited to you buying and selling cryptoassets on our platform.  
3.2 
You may transfer cryptoassets from your eToro account into an eToro X account, as explained in 
paragraph  – "Transfer of cryptoassets". This service is subject to certain limitations as described in 
paragraph 6 (which may be changed from time to time) and we may choose to revoke it at our sole 
discretion subject to a prior notice. 
 
 
44 
 
4. 
Placing orders 
4.1 
Please refer to clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how you may place 
an order and provide trading instructions on the eToro platform. 
4.2 
Each order given by you will be binding on you notwithstanding that by entering into the order as 
applicable, you may have exceeded any limit applicable to you or in respect of your dealings with us.  
4.3 
We are not required to accept every order that you make, or if we have accepted your order we are 
not required to complete/execute every order. For example, we may not accept an order, not execute 
or complete an order, or cancel an order: 
(a) 
for the reasons set out in clause 19.2 of the General Terms and Conditions; 
(b) 
due to the size of the order, for example large orders which cannot be filled; 
(c) 
because we cease to offer the cryptoasset product; 
(d) 
if you do not have enough margin to fund a leveraged cryptoasset trade; and/or 
(e) 
because you exceed any limits applicable to you or in respect of your dealings with us and other 
matters that affect trading generally. 
4.4 
As provided in clause 19.1 of the General Terms and Conditions, you may request to cancel or modify 
an order which we have not executed. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to carry out 
your request. In addition to this clause, we are not liable to you if we are unable to carry out your 
request. You acknowledge and agree that:  
(a) 
if an order cannot be cancelled or modified, you are bound by any execution of the original 
order; 
(b) 
attempts to modify or cancel and replace an order can result in an over-execution of the order 
or the execution of duplicate orders. Our systems do not prevent such over-executions or 
duplications from occurring, and therefore you shall be responsible for all such over-executions 
or duplications; and 
(c) 
if you enter a cancellation request, you will confirm that the cancellation has occurred prior to 
entering into any replacement orders. 
4.5 
You are responsible for monitoring your orders until they are confirmed or cancelled, as we may not 
provide you with explicit written notification. You should contact us immediately if you are unsure about 
the status of an order. 
4.6 
As provided in clause 18.6 of the General Terms and Conditions, we cannot guarantee that your 
execution price will match your order price. This is known as slippage. To be clear: 
(a) 
if you place a cryptoasset order (whether during normal market hours or when the market is 
closed), you agree to pay or receive the prevailing market price at the time your market order 
is executed. You understand that the price you pay may be significantly higher or lower than 
you had anticipated at the time you placed the order, and therefore such price movements may 
be in your favour or against you; and 
(b) 
there is no guarantee that your order will be filled in full or in part. Where a delay occurs for 
any reason, we will attempt to execute the order as soon as reasonably practicable. You 
acknowledge and accept that the market price of the cryptoasset may have moved during the 
time between our receipt and acceptance of your order and our attempt to execute order; 
4.7 
You acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to cause any of your cryptoasset orders to be 
routed for execution to one or more exchanges or off-exchanges, associations, electronic 
communications networks or markets according to our sole discretion. 
4.8 
Unless we agree otherwise, all sums payable by you are due immediately and must be paid on entering 
into the transaction.  
 
45 
 
5. 
Using leverage and Margin Transactions 
5.1 
You may trade cryptoassets by paying for the trade in full, or we may allow you to trade cryptoassets 
using leverage for any buy orders ("Margin Transaction"). Leverage is a form of borrowing which 
allows you to deposit only a part of the cost of your transaction upfront. This deposit is called "margin" 
and is used by us as security against any potential losses you may incur. The more leverage you use, 
the less margin you need. Money being used as margin cannot be taken out of your account. 
5.2 
Trading with leverage magnifies your gains and losses, so small price changes in the cryptoasset can 
result in large losses or gains. It is therefore possible that you may lose more than your deposit in a 
trade. We provide more information on the risks of trading cryptoassets, including trading cryptoassets 
using leverage in paragraph 7 – "The key risks of trading cryptoassets", the General Risk Disclosure, 
and on our website. 
5.3 
Eligibility to the Margin Transactions shall be determined by us according to our internal procedures 
and requirements and at our sole and absolute discretion. We reserve the right to refuse your ability 
to access Margin Transactions, including generally or on a specific trade by trade basis, and for any 
reason. We may not provide you with prior notice, or an explanation of our refusal.    
5.4 
The cryptoassets purchased in a Margin Transaction and any asset resulting from any Fork in relation 
thereto are our collateral for the loan provided to you and any fees related due thereon. If the 
cryptoassets in such Margin Transaction decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting 
your loan, and as a result we can take action, such as sell those cryptoassets in order to maintain the 
required equity. If such cryptoassets are not sufficient to cover your debt to us (including any fees) we 
may use in our sole discretion, subject to any Applicable Law, any other assets and/or funds in your 
account (including liquidation of such assets, if permitted under Applicable Law).  
5.5 
There is no maximum leverage amount prescribed by Applicable Law. The amount of leverage permitted 
(and therefore margin required) shall be determined by us in our sole discretion. We can decrease the 
leverage (and therefore increase the margin requirement) as well as change the leverage (and 
therefore change the margin requirement) we offer at any time, including for any open positions.   
5.6 
We can change margin requirements at our sole discretion (including in relation to open 
positions), and we may give you very short notice of changes to margin requirements or due 
to an Exceptional Event we may not be able to give you notice at all. We will exercise our right 
to change margin requirements in accordance with Appliable Law. These changes often take effect 
immediately. When margin requirements change, we cannot guarantee that your execution price will 
match your order price, including where you've placed a limit order, take profit and/or stop loss order.    
5.7 
You acknowledge that eToro will not issue margin calls in respect to Margin Transactions. It is your sole 
responsibility to monitor at all times the amount deposited in your transactions against the amount of 
any margin that may become necessary. It  is your sole responsibility to follow up whether your 
transaction is about to be closed due to margins requirement as shall be indicated in the Trading 
Platform.  
5.8 
Where you transfer more funds into your account to satisfy an increased margin requirement, we are 
not responsible for delays in the release of funds intended to satisfy the margin requirement, including 
but not limited to internal holds on funds exceeding verification limits, delays in the transfer of funds 
from external accounts maintained by third party financial institutions, and failure of proper routing of 
funds through financial networks. The funds won't count towards their Margin Requirements until they 
are released. 
5.9 
If you fail to satisfy the margin requirement we will liquidate your Margin Transaction (i.e. we will force 
sale your cryptoassets) in order to satisfy the margin requirements without prior notice to you and 
without an opportunity for you to choose the timing of liquidation. We may but are not obligated to, in 
our sole discretion, allow you to add funds into the position to avoid any forced liquidation of your 
cryptoassets.  
5.10 
Any requirement for margin must be satisfied in such currency and within such time as may be specified 
by us (in our sole discretion) or, if none is specified, immediately. One margin requirement does not 
preclude another. 
5.11 
The consideration from the liquidation of the collateral will be used first to pay off interest before 
principal. Any unpaid loan shall continue to accrue overnight fees until the loan amount shall have been 
paid in full.  
 
46 
 
5.12 
We provide all clients with negative balance protection. This means that your aggregate liability in your 
Account is limited to the funds in your Account. 
5.13 
In addition to our rights at paragraph 14 – "Our rights and your rights in special circumstances", we 
reserve the right to close any open Margin Transactions positions, in a fair way and taking into account 
the treatment we may receive from our counterparties and/or any relevant third party if an Exceptional 
Event has occurred, as defined in clause 29 of the General Terms and Conditions. 
5.14 
You hereby grant us the right to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, reuse, invest, either 
separately or with the property of other customers, to itself as broker or to others (including as part of 
our financing transactions), any cryptoassets or asset held for your benefit by eToro as margin or 
security. eToro is irrevocably appointed as attorney in-fact for you and is authorized, without notice to 
you, to execute and deliver any documents, give any notice and to take any actions on your behalf, 
including the execution, delivery and filing of financing statements, that eToro deems necessary or 
desirable to evidence or to protect our interest with respect to any collateral. Our rights under this 
paragraph is subject to Applicable Law, and therefore we will not exercise the rights if you are a resident 
in a jurisdiction which prohibits you granting such rights to us. 
6. 
Transfer of cryptoassets 
6.1 
Where you purchase certain types of cryptoassets on our platform (except for Margin Transactions as 
defined in this Schedule), we allow you to transfer your cryptoassets to a wallet opened in your name 
with eToro X Limited ("eToro X") or, if you are a German citizen, with eToro Germany GmbH (together, 
the "eToro Wallet"), subject to paragraph 6.2 below. This may also depend on the ability of eToro X 
or the eToro Wallet to provide services into the relevant jurisdiction in which you are domiciled. In this 
scenario, the cryptoassets will be stored in your eToro Wallet. However, we may pause or stop this 
facility with a prior notice. You cannot use this functionality to transfer cryptoassets to wallets held by 
other third parties. Cryptoassets bought in a Margin Transaction (see paragraph 5 – "Using leverage 
and Margin Transactions") have no transfer option. 
6.2 
This transfer service of your cryptoassets to the eToro Wallet is subject to certain limitations and 
conditions as eToro may set from time to time. We will seek to provide relevant notice of such 
limitations to the extent we are reasonably able. The limitations may include, but are not limited to, 
your domiciliation, applicable regulation and any liabilities that you may owe towards eToro being 
settled in advance of the transfer. Further, not all types of cryptoassets are supported for this transfer 
service and your ability to transfer your cryptoassets and the timing of such transfer is affected by the 
original means of payment of your deposit as well as other factors such as AML rules, internal 
procedures and applicable regulations. Further information may be found here: Crypto FAQ and here: 
Crypto Fees and Limitations. Please also check on our website whether you can open an eToro Wallet 
in your jurisdiction.  
6.3 
The cryptoassets that you transfer to your eToro Wallet may not be transferred back to your eToro 
account, and you cannot exchange them for currencies (such as US Dollars or Sterling). 
6.4 
If you choose to open an eToro X account and use its features, including transferring cryptoassets from 
your eToro account to your eToro Wallet, then you will be subject to eToro X's separate Terms and 
Conditions. These can be found on the eToro X website. We may charge a fee for transferring your 
cryptoassets from us to eToro X. We provide more details of the fees that may apply to you when you 
are trading or transferring cryptoassets in paragraph 11 - "Fees and costs". 
6.5 
Where you transfer your cryptoassets to your eToro Wallet, you will not be able to make a 
chargeback claim against us in relation to the that transfer.

Our cryptoasset trading and especially Margin Transactions service is not appropriate for everyone. 
Cryptoassets are volatile products, which means the prices of the products can change rapidly, and are 
therefore unpredictable. Prices can and do fluctuate significantly on any given day. Due to these price 
fluctuations, your holdings may significantly increase or decrease in value at any given moment, and 
this may result in a loss of all the capital you have invested in a transaction (the risk of losing money 
is even greater in Margin Transactions due to the use of leverage).  
7.2 
You should only use our cryptoassets trading service (including for Margin Transactions) if: 
(a) 
you have sufficient and relevant knowledge about or experience in, trading in volatile markets;  
 
47 
 
(b) 
you are trading with money you can afford to lose;  
(c) 
you have a high-risk tolerance;  
(d) 
you want to gain short term exposure to a product/market; and 
(e) 
you have time to manage your transactions on an active basis and understand that active 
management may be required at short notice due to the volatility of the cryptoasset market 
(which will be increased in relation to Margin Transactions). 
7.3 
The most important risks when trading cryptoassets (which are even greater in Margin Transactions) 
are: 
(a) 
particularly during periods of high volume, illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the 
marketplace for any cryptoassets, the actual market rate at which a market order or trade is 
executed may be different from the prevailing rate indicated via the cryptoassets trading 
services at the time of your order or trade; 
(b) 
the actual market rate at which a market order or trade is executed may be different from the 
rate that is displayed on the eToro platform at the time that you make your order, if prices are 
fluctuating substantially; 
(c) 
cryptoassets are a unique kind of product, backed by technology and trust, unlike most 
currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such 
as gold or silver. This means there is no central bank that can take corrective measure to 
protect the value of cryptoassets in a crisis; 
(d) 
as cryptoassets are virtual products, they may become 'delisted' or unsupported at any time, 
which means they may no longer be offered for sale or exchange on markets. If this happens, 
the cryptoassets may become worthless. Please refer to paragraph 14 – "Our rights and your 
rights in special circumstances" for further information on how we may treat positions in such 
events; 
(e) 
under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position, 
such as where the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit or where there is insufficient 
liquidity in the market; 
(f) 
as cryptoassets are digital assets, there is a risk that third parties may obtain unauthorised 
access to your information and/or your assets;  
(g) 
cryptoassets are often traded using independent blockchain technology. Your use of blockchain 
and other third party networks will be subject to any changes and/or amendments in their 
systems and to any Applicable Law which may apply to them. We are not responsible for any 
failure, mistake, error, or breach of third party networks. We also do not make any guarantee 
about the services provided by and the security of third party networks; 
(h) 
cryptoassets are operated by underlying software protocols. We do not own or control the 
software underlying the cryptoassets in respect of which cryptoasset are available for trading 
on our platform. In general, the underlying software protocols are 'open source', which means 
anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. The underlying protocols are subject to 
sudden changes in operating rules (called "Forks"), and such Forks may materially affect the 
value, function, and/or even the name of the cryptoasset which we hold for your benefit. We 
explain your rights and our rights if a fork occurs in more detail in paragraph 14 – "Our rights 
and your rights in special circumstances";  
(i) 
we may execute orders through, or hold cryptoassets and currencies with, a third party. These 
third parties may not be banks. This means that, if a company holding the currencies or 
cryptoassets fails, is hacked, or goes out of business, your money and assets are not protected 
in the same way as they would be if they were held by a bank. In particular, we may only have 
an unsecured claim against that third party on your behalf, which means that you are less likely 
to recover your money; and 
 
48 
 
(j) 
cryptoassets are unregulated products. This means that, when you invest in cryptoassets, 
losses incurred due to cryptoasset trading will not be eligible for government compensation. 
Please see paragraph 2 – "Investor protection and compensation" for more information on this. 
7.4 
You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding cryptoassets is suitable for you, in 
light of your financial circumstances. You should ensure that you fully understand how cryptoassets 
work (including all associated risks and costs) before using our cryptoassets trading services.  
7.5 
Please refer to clause 5 of the General Terms and Conditions, the General Risk Disclosure, and our 
website for more information on the key risks of using our services. 
Margin Transactions 
7.6 
In addition to the above you should only trade Margin Transactions if you have time to manage your 
transactions on an active basis and understand that active management may be required at short 
notice: 
(a) 
due to the volatility of the cryptoasset market, which will be increased as a result of leverage; 
(b) 
as a result of us changing margin requirements, including for open positions (as stated below); 
and/or 
(c) 
as a result of us giving you very short notice, or due to an Exceptional Event no notice at all, 
of changes to margin requirements (as stated below); 
7.7 
In addition to the risks highlighted above, the following risks specifically associated with Margin 
Transactions:  
(a) 
You can lose more funds than you deposit in the Margin Transaction. The price 
fluctuation of cryptoassets, in combination with the use of leverage, means that your Margin 
Transaction may significantly increase or decrease in value at any given moment, and this may 
result in a loss of more than the capital that you originally invested in such Margin Transaction. 
Therefore, Margin Transactions come with an even higher risk of losing money, and the risk of 
losing more money, than compared to non-margined cryptoassets.  
(b) 
We can force the sale of assets in your account. A decline in the value of cryptoassets that 
are purchased on margin may require you to add funds to such transaction to avoid the forced 
sale of those cryptoassets or other assets in your account. If the cryptoassets in a Margin 
Transaction falls below the margin requirements, we can sell the cryptoassets in your account 
to cover the margin deficiency. You will also be responsible for any shortfall in the account after 
such a sale.  
(c) 
We can sell your cryptoassets without contacting you. We are not required to contact 
you for a margin call to be valid and we can liquidate cryptoassets in your accounts to meet 
the margin requirements, including immediately selling the cryptoassets without notice to you.  
(d) 
We can change margin requirements at our sole discretion (including in relation to 
open positions), and we may give you very short notice of changes to margin 
requirements or due to an Exceptional Event we may not be able to give you notice 
at all. We will exercise our right to change margin requirements in accordance with Appliable 
Law. These changes often take effect immediately. When margin requirements change, we 
cannot guarantee that your execution price will match your order price, including where you've 
placed a limit order, take profit and/or stop loss order. Please refer to paragraph 5 – "Using 
leverage and Margin Transactions" for further information on changes to margin requirements. 
Your failure to satisfy margin requirements may, as described above cause us to liquidate or 
sell cryptoassets or other assets in your account. We are not responsible to delays in the release 
of funds intended to satisfy the call, including but not limited to internal holds on funds 
exceeding verification limits, delays in the transfer of funds from external accounts maintained 
by third party financial institutions, and failure of proper routing of funds through financial 
networks. The funds won't count towards their margin requirements until they are released.

8. 
Limitation on liability 
8.1 
Cryptoassets are highly speculative assets which rely on a number of external variables for their 
existence and value. As a result, there are a number of additional risks and liabilities that you will be 
exposed to when trading cryptoassets. This paragraph sets out a number of these liabilities and explains 
the circumstances under which we will not be liable for any losses, costs, or expenses that you suffer 
subject to Applicable Law. 
8.2 
We are not liable to you where you suffer a loss, cost, or expense as a result of: 
(a) 
any delay or change in market conditions before we execute an order or before a transaction 
settles; 
(b) 
any delay or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, 
worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment, any cyber-attack 
or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily 
available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and 
email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing 
messages purporting to originate from us; 
(c) 
any loss caused by theft, robbery, burglary or other criminal taking if a computer, computer 
system, computer software program, malicious code, computer virus or process or any other 
electronic system is used to perform such acts;  
(d) 
any loss of any kind resulting from any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions 
or delays you may experience when trading on the eToro platform, regardless of how they are 
caused; 
(e) 
any loss resulting from a network failure of a cryptoasset's cryptographic protocol;  
(f) 
any loss caused by a custodian and/or by any third party;  
(g) 
any lost profits or damages that are caused by or are connected to unauthorised use of the 
eToro platform or services, even where we or one of our representatives knew or should 
reasonably have known about the possibility of such damages; and 
(h) 
any loss of any kind, from action taken in reliance on material or information, contained on 
eToro's trading platform or websites and/or on the blockchain systems. 
8.3 
Neither eToro Europe, its affiliates and service providers, nor any of their respective officers, directors, 
agents, joint venture partners, employees or representatives, will be liable for any amount larger than 
the value of the cryptoassets currently deposited in your account. As a result, for example, if you claim 
that we failed to process a buy or a sell transaction properly, your damages are limited to no more 
than the value of the supported cryptoasset at issue in the transaction. 
8.4 
We also do not promise or guarantee that: 
(a) 
the trading platform, and the server that makes it available, are free of viruses or errors, that 
its content is accurate, that it will be uninterrupted, or that defects will be corrected;  
(b) 
the service will be available at all times; 
(c) 
access to our website, any part of the services, our terms and other information provided by 
us or any part of our services will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or error-free; or 
(d) 
historical cryptoasset price data available on the trading platform is accurate and/or complete. 
8.5 
The services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any representation or 
warranty, whether express, implied or statutory. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, 
we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose 
and/or non-infringement.  
8.6 
Please refer to clause 25 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the general 
limitations to our liability when you trade using any of our services.

9. 
Placing an order 
Please refer to clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions for information on how you may place 
an order and provide trading instructions on the eToro platform. 
10. 
Staking 
10.1 
When you hold cryptoassets with us, we may 'stake' these cryptoassets in a third party 'proof of stake' 
network through staking services provided by us ("Staking Service"). 'Staking' is where cryptoassets 
are held in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operation of a blockchain network ("Staked 
Cryptoassets"). In a proof of stake network, transaction validators are chosen using a formula based 
on ownership of the underlying cryptoassets (as opposed to based on computing power, known as 
'proof of work'). Please visit our staking information page for further details on how proof of stake 
works. 
10.2 
As part of the Staking Service we or any third party appointed by us will stake certain Staked 
Cryptoassets on your behalf, acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network. If we or 
anyone on our behalf successfully validates a block of transactions using that Staked Cryptoasset, a 
reward is granted by that cryptoassets’ network (a "Staking Reward"). The more Staked Cryptoassets, 
the greater the chance of receiving a Staking Reward.  
10.3 
When you buy or hold a Staked Cryptoasset from us, you consent to such Staked Cryptoassets being 
staked in part or in entirety by us, or a third party on our behalf, in our sole discretion. We will disclose 
the Staked Cryptoassets at our staking information page (as amended by us from time to time).  
10.4 
We may amend, change or update your Staked Cryptoassets at any time and without prior notice. We 
may choose to engage service providers to stake some or all of your cryptoassets. We do not represent, 
warrant or guarantee that: 
(a) 
you will receive any stated percentage of any Staking Rewards;  
(b) 
staking will occur on a continuous basis;  
(c) 
staking will occur on an uninterrupted or error-free basis, or that we will correct all defects or 
prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorised third party access (and in the event of such 
disruptions, any Staked Cryptoassets may not generate Staking Rewards); or  
(d) 
any particular cryptoasset will be staked or will continue to be staked.  
10.5 
We may choose to cease staking any cryptoasset at any time in our sole discretion. 
10.6 
Where we distribute Staking Rewards to you, we will aim do so at the rates set out at our staking 
information page and only after receipt by us. The percentage and timing of Staking Rewards will:  
(a) 
be determined by us in our sole discretion;  
(b) 
be subject to our fees and any costs incurred for such transactions;  
(c) 
vary according between Staked Cryptoassets; and  
(d) 
be detailed in your trading account.    
10.7 
You agree that we do not guarantee that we will distribute Staking Rewards to you, and that where we 
do so, the applicable percentage of Staking Rewards set out at our staking information page: 
(a) 
are estimates only and are not guaranteed;  
(b) 
may change at any time in our sole discretion; and  
(c) 
may be more or less than the Staking Rewards we receive.  
 
 
 
52 
 
10.8 
A determination by the third party proof of stake network that the Staking Service has been erroneously 
operated may result in a "slashing penalty", and the non-payment of the relevant Staking Rewards. 
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your cryptoassets will not be subject to a 
slashing penalty, but in the unlikely event they are, we will promptly replace your relevant cryptoassets 
assets at no additional cost to you, except where the relevant slashing penalty is as a result of: 
(a) 
your acts or omissions;  
(b) 
any supported protocol maintenance, bugs, or errors;  
(c) 
acts by a hacker or other malicious actor; or  
(d) 
force majeure events.  
11. 
Fees and costs 
11.1 
Please refer to clause 21 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the fees and 
costs which apply to all transactions on the eToro platform. 
11.2 
If you transfer your cryptoasset into a different account, for example an account operated by eToro X, 
we will charge you a "transfer fee", and you will also incur a third party fee called a "blockchain fee".  
11.3 
If you sell cryptoassets, the consideration for the transaction, less commission and all applicable 
charges and taxes, will be available on your account for reinvestment, but you will not be able to 
withdraw it from your account until the transaction has settled.  
11.4 
If you enter into a Margin Transaction, we will charge an overnight fee each time you keep a position 
open after trading hours, including on public and bank holidays. If you keep your position over the 
weekend, we will charge you for two nights. The overnight fee will be taken out of the available balance 
in your eToro account. How the overnight fee is calculated will be different depending on your 
underlying product, the amount of leverage being utilised, and whether you are entering into a buy or 
a sell trade. Our overnight fees are subject to change and can be viewed on our website, and the 
overnight fee relevant to your order will also be displayed to you when you open a position. 
11.5 
Additional charges may also be incurred by you in the case of the delayed or failed settlement of a 
transaction. Any such amounts will be your responsibility and, where appropriate, will be deducted 
from your account. This may occur where there is low demand for a cryptoasset that you want to trade 
on the platform, meaning that there is a period of time between you choosing to sell the cryptoassets 
and it being bought on the platform. 
12. 
Settlement 
12.1 
We are not responsible for any delay in the settlement of a transaction resulting from circumstances 
beyond our control, or the failure of any other person or party (including you) to perform all necessary 
steps to enable completion on the settlement date. 
12.2 
We may refuse to allow a withdrawal on any account that you have with us if it would leave insufficient 
funds in the account to pay for any unsettled transactions. Where you make payment into your account 
and then make a withdrawal shortly afterwards, we reserve the right to delay settlement for up to eight 
business days to ensure your payment has cleared. 
13. 
Custody 
13.1 
Cryptoassets are not regulated products and, therefore, trades or copy trades related to cryptoassets 
are not subject to Applicable Law on custody. However, we will endeavour to protect your assets in 
accordance with best market practice and to the extent possible in accordance with CySEC rules. In 
particular: 
(a) 
we may appoint an affiliate or third party to hold cryptoassets on your behalf, and we will 
exercise reasonable skill and care in the selection, appointment and periodic review of the firm 
we appoint. In this circumstance, the cryptoassets may be held in the affiliate or third party's 
'wallet', or in another appropriate manner;  
 
53 
 
(b) 
we, an appointed affiliate, or an appointed third party, may hold the cryptoassets which you've 
bought on our platform, until we receive further instructions from you to sell or transfer that 
cryptoasset, to the extent we support such transfer functionality; 
(c) 
where we, our appointed affiliate or appointed third party hold your cryptoassets, those 
cryptoassets will be pooled with the cryptoassets of our other clients (we call this an "Omnibus 
Account"). There is a risk of loss from the use of an omnibus account. However, detailed 
records of all your cryptoassets held by us, our appointed affiliate, or the appointed third party, 
will be kept at all times to show that your cryptoassets are held on your behalf in order to 
mitigate that loss; and 
(d) 
as your cryptoassets are held in an Omnibus Account, if we, our appointed affiliate, or the 
appointed third party become insolvent, you may not have a legal claim against a specific 
amount of money, or a specific amount of cryptoasset. Instead, any claim will be generally 
against the Omnibus Account. If there is an unreconciled shortfall, you may not receive your 
full entitlement to the cryptoasset, or the value of the cryptoasset in fiat money (e.g. currencies 
such as US Dollars or Sterling) and you may share the shortfall proportionately with other 
clients. 
13.2 
If you are resident in Germany, the following applies to you in addition to paragraph 13.1:  
(a) 
custody services for the cryptoassets (Kryptoverwahrgeschäft) provided to you are regulated 
by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ("BaFin") and are subject to the German 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), as implemented by the Amending Directive on the Fourth EU 
Anti-Money Laundering Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Änderungsrichtlinie zur Vierten 
EU-Geldwäscherichtlinie);  
(b) 
eToro Germany GmbH, with its registered office at Tower 185 - 19th Floor SER Friedrich-Ebert-
Anlage 35-37, 60327 Frankfurt am Main ("eToro Germany") will provide custody services for 
the cryptoassets held by you, in accordance with BaFin rules. eToro Germany is an eToro Group 
entity; and  
(c) 
Appendix 2 to this Schedule C will also apply to you.  
13.3 
If you are resident in Netherlands, the following applies to you: 
eToro (Europe) Ltd is registered with De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. ("DNB") as a provider of cryptoasset 
services. DNB supervises the compliance of eToro (Europe) Ltd with the Prevention of Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act and the Sanctions Act 1977. However, eToro (Europe) Ltd is 
not subject to the prudential supervision of the DNB or the conduct of business supervision of the Dutch 
Authority for the Financial Markets ("AFM"). This means that for cryptoasset services, there is no 
supervision of financial requirements or business risks and there is no specific financial consumer 
protection. 
14. 
Our rights and your rights in special circumstances 
14.1 
If you place an order on our trading platform and then one or more of the cryptoassets that form the 
subject of your order is delisted and/or we no longer support the trading in such cryptoassets for any 
reason, then we will immediately close your order and notify you of this as soon as possible.  
14.2 
If we reasonably become aware that a cryptoasset that you hold in your account is likely to be delisted, 
removed and/or cancelled from any of the exchanges on which it is listed and we believe that we are 
not able to trade in such cryptoassets, we reserve the right to sell the impacted cryptoassets on your 
behalf at the time and price, and in such manner, as we determine is reasonable in the circumstances 
at our sole discretion. We will notify you as soon as possible before selling your cryptoassets.  
14.3 
If at any time trading on the underlying market is suspended in any cryptoasset that forms the subject 
of your order, then the applicable order will also be suspended and you will not be able to sell any 
cryptoasset we hold on your behalf until such suspension is terminated and trading recommences. 
14.4 
When the suspension referred to in paragraph 14.3 is lifted, any order that you may have given us with 
respect to the cryptoasset that have been triggered will be executed as soon as is reasonable in the 
circumstances. We cannot guarantee that your order will be executed at the first available Underlying 
Market price or at all. 
 
54 
 
14.5 
We do not own or control the software underlying the cryptoassets that are available for trading on our 
platform. In general, the underlying software protocols are 'open source', which means anyone can 
use, copy, modify, and distribute them. The underlying protocols which govern cryptoassets are subject 
to sudden changes in operating rules, known as "Forks". Forks can materially affect the way in which 
cryptoassets are valued, their function, and even the name of the cryptoasset which we hold for your 
benefit, and can create extreme price volatility. 
14.6 
By using our cryptoassets trading service, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for 
operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality, security, 
reliability or availability. You also acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility or liability in 
respect of an unsupported branch of a forked cryptoasset. 
14.7 
When a Fork occurs, we may temporarily suspend trading on the eToro platforms (with or without 
advance notice to you). We may then, at our discretion:  
(a) 
configure or reconfigure its systems;  
(b) 
determine which of the forked cryptoassets has the majority consensus behind it and offer this 
cryptoasset on our trading platform; and/or  
(c) 
decide not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked cryptoasset entirely. 
14.8 
In the event of a Fork, you acknowledge and agree that we may decide at our sole discretion to adjust 
the cryptoasset holdings in your account with respect to any affected cryptoasset held by you. Such 
adjustment shall be calculated by us and will be made on the basis of good faith, fairness and, where 
appropriate, by taking such action as is consistent with market practice and/or taking into account the 
treatment we may receive from our counterparties or any relevant third party. We may deduct any 
applicable tax, but we may also make these adjustments without deducting any taxes that will apply 
to you as a result of the adjustment. You will be obligated to pay the taxes that you are responsible for 
where we have not made tax deductions on your behalf. 
14.9 
We will not usually notify you before making a change to your portfolio under paragraph 14.8. Therefore, 
you should make yourself aware of the market conditions and the Forks that could occur. When a hard 
Fork occurs, there may be substantial price volatility around the event, and we may suspend trading if 
we do not have reliable prices from the underlying market. 
14.10 
In the event that a situation arises that is not covered under Schedule, or the General Terms and 
Conditions, we will resolve the matter on the basis of good faith and fairness and, where appropriate, 
by taking such action as is consistent with market practice. 
14.11 
Please refer to Part 3 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information about our rights and 
your rights in special circumstances across all our services.

Appendix 1 
Situations in which Cryptoasset Trading Services are Differentiated 
Even though your transaction may relate to cryptoassets, we do not execute certain transactions, through our 
cryptoasset trading service. 
Where the transaction will be listed as a CFD transaction, this will be indicated on the trading platform 
and/or account statement.  
Where we do not execute your trade through our cryptoasset trading service, your trade will be 
executed as a CFD transaction. Accordingly, you should to refer to Schedule A – Trading CFDs, and 
Appendix 1 of Schedule A, instead of this Schedule C – Trading Cryptoassets where your transaction 
falls into one of the categories listed above. 
The following transactions shall be executed as CFDs:  
(a) 
transactions where you enter into a short trade on cryptoassets; 
(b) 
cryptoassets copy trading (including CopyPortfolio) transactions classified as CFDs in the 
account of the copied investor, unless otherwise indicated in the Trading Platform; 
(c) 
all or certain types of transactions in cryptoassets (including CopyTrade and CopyPortfolio 
transactions where you are copying a transaction in cryptoassets or a portfolio that includes 
cryptoassets) made by users from certain countries (as a result of any liquidity restriction or 
regulatory restriction or any other reason as shall be determined by us in our sole discretion), 
as shall be amended from time to time at our sole discretion (this includes also reclassifying 
your open trades). Such transactions will be indicated on the trading platform and in your 
account statement as CFD transactions; 
(d) 
all cross transactions of cryptoassets with other cryptoassets (e.g. ETH/BTC) and/or with 
currency (e.g. ETH/EUR, BTC/EUR).  
This is not an exhaustive list so there may be other transactions that we are unable to execute as 
cryptoasset transactions (according to our sole discretion), as shall be indicated in our trading 
platform and/or account statement.

2. 
Regulatory status of cryptoassets for German clients 
Custody services for the cryptoassets provided to German clients by eToro Germany are regulated by 
BaFin and are subject to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), as implemented by the 
Amending Directive on the Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der 
Änderungsrichtlinie zur Vierten EU-Geldwäscherichtlinie). eToro Germany does not carry out any 
activities 
subject 
to 
approval 
under 
the 
German 
Payment 
Services 
Supervision 
Act 
(Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz) when it provides custody of your cryptoassets.  
3. 
Custody of cryptoassets for German clients 
3.1 
When you trade cryptoassets with eToro Europe, you will receive the custody services from eToro 
Germany and the terms and conditions of this Appendix 2 shall apply to these custody services. All of 
the Services provided to you by eToro Europe will continue to be provided by eToro Europe in 
accordance with the terms of the General Terms and Conditions and the Schedules applicable to you. 
3.2 
When you trade cryptoassets with eToro, you place each order with eToro Europe to buy or sell 
cryptoassets under clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions, and you give consent to eToro 
Germany to hold your cryptoassets on your behalf. When you place an order with eToro Europe to buy 
cryptoassets, you are also giving an instruction to eToro Germany to hold these cryptoassets on your 
behalf, and when you place an order with eToro Europe to sell cryptoassets, you are also giving eToro 
Germany an instruction to cease to hold those cryptoassets on your behalf.  
3.3 
eToro Germany may hold your cryptoassets with those cryptoassets of other clients in an Omnibus 
Account. There is a risk of loss from the use of an Omnibus Account. As your cryptoassets are held in 
an Omnibus Account, if we, our appointed affiliate, or the appointed third party become insolvent, you 
may not have a legal claim against a specific amount of money, or a specific amount of cryptoasset. 
Instead, any claim will be generally against the Omnibus Account. If there is an unreconciled shortfall, 
you may not receive your full entitlement to the cryptoasset, or the value of the cryptoasset in fiat 
money (such as US Dollars or Sterling) and you may share the shortfall proportionately with other 
clients. However, detailed records of all your cryptoassets held by eToro Germany will be kept at all 
times to show that your cryptoassets are held on your behalf in order to mitigate that risk of loss. 
3.4 
To the extent permitted by applicable law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the German Banking 
Act) eToro Germany may appoint an affiliate or third party to hold cryptoassets on your behalf, and 
will exercise reasonable skill and care in the selection, appointment and periodic review of any such 
firms appointed. In these circumstances, cryptoassets may be held in the affiliate or third party's 'wallet', 
or in another appropriate manner. In addition, subject to applicable law, eToro Germany may be fully 
replaced with another German entity (compliant with all applicable law and regulation) to perform the 
custody services of your cryptoassets under this Appendix 2.

4. 
Data protection 
4.1 
For eToro Germany to provide custody of your cryptoassets, eToro Europe may transfer your personal 
data to eToro Germany or other parties in accordance with clause 36 of the General Terms and 
Conditions and eToro's Privacy Notice. eToro Germany may collect, store and process information from 
you or otherwise in connection with the purpose of providing cryptoassets custody services to you and 
of complying with Applicable Law and / or regulation, including disclosures to governmental authorities.  
4.2 
eToro Europe and eToro Germany will put in place and maintain appropriate technical and 
organisational measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of your personal data, and will 
implement and maintain appropriate security controls to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your 
personal data.

required in connection with its provision of cryptoasset custody services to you in accordance with the

By using our cryptoassets trading service, you acknowledge and agree that eToro Europe and eToro

cryptoasset. Such adjustment will be made on the basis of good faith, fairness and, where appropriate, 
by taking such action as is consistent with market practice and/or taking into account the treatment 
eToro may receive from our counterparties or any relevant third party. eToro may deduct any applicable 
tax, but we may also make these adjustments without deducting any taxes that will apply to you as a 
result of the adjustment. You will be obligated to pay the taxes that you are responsible for where we 
have not made tax deductions on your behalf. 
5.3 
In the event that a situation arises that is not covered under this Appendix 2, Schedule 3, or the General 
Terms and Conditions, we will resolve the matter on the basis of good faith and fairness and, where 
appropriate, by taking such action as is consistent with market practice. 
6. 
Limitation on liability  
6.1 
Cryptoassets are highly speculative assets which rely on a number of external variables for their 
existence and value. As a result, there are a number of additional risks and liabilities that you will be 
exposed to when trading cryptoassets, including when they are held in custody. This paragraph sets 
out a number of these liabilities and explains the circumstances under which eToro EU and eToro 
Germany will not be liable for any losses, costs, or expenses that you suffer subject to Applicable Law. 
6.2 
eToro Germany is not liable to you where you suffer a loss, cost, or expense as a result of:

custody (given in accordance with paragraph 3.2 of this Appendix 2) to hold or cease to hold 
your cryptoassets; 
(b) 
any loss resulting from a network failure of a cryptoasset's cryptographic protocol;

party;

Germany or any of eToro EU or eToro Germany's affiliates or representatives knew or should 
reasonably have known about the possibility of such damages; and

any loss caused by theft, robbery, burglary or other criminal taking if a computer, computer 
system, computer software program, malicious code, computer virus or process or any other 
electronic system is used to perform such acts;

any loss of any kind, from action taken in reliance on material or information, contained on 
eToro's trading platform or websites and/or on the blockchain systems that results in an 
instruction to eToro Germany to hold or cease to hold your cryptoassets in custody (in 
accordance with paragraph 3.2 of this Appendix 2). 
6.3 
eToro Germany, any affiliates and service providers, nor any of its respective officers, directors, agents, 
joint venture partners, employees or representatives, will be liable for any amount larger than the

SCHEDULE D – COPY TRADING 
This Schedule D sets out the specific terms that will apply to you when using the copy trading functionality on 
the eToro platform. The terms in this Schedule D apply to you in addition to the General Terms and Conditions, 
which apply to all of our services and not just to copy trading. Capitalised words in this Schedule D will have the 
same meaning which are given to those word in the General Terms and Conditions. If a term of this Schedule D 
conflicts with or differs from a term in the General Terms and Conditions, this Schedule D will apply. 
1. 
What is copy trading 
1.1 
When using the copy trading services, you are agreeing to use our investment management services. 
1.2 
The eToro platform provides you with the ability to interact, follow and copy other traders, strategies 
and/or portfolios by using the information, as well as providing you with "social trading features". 
Social trading features include detailed account information, trading histories, risk profiles, and other 
information in relation to eToro traders, strategies and/or portfolios that may be useful to you when 
deciding whether to copy such eToro trader, strategy and/or portfolio. 
1.3 
Copy trading is a trading functionality which allows you to copy the account of other traders. You do 
this by either copying a specific eToro trader account or copying a portfolio (we explain what this means 
below). By placing a copy order, you authorise us to automatically recreate this account for you in your 
eToro account without any prior consultation, consent or approval. This will be done on a pro rata basis 
with the same products and the same trading instructions (unless such action would be in contravention 
of Applicable Law). For example, we may start copy trading, stop copy trading and/or pause the copying 
of the copied trader, account, portfolio and/or strategy and set limits to any position etc.  
1.4 
Please read paragraph 2 – "Our copy trading service", and paragraph 8 – "Placing an order" for more 
information on how to place a copy trade on the eToro platform. 
2. 
Our copy trading service 
2.1 
We offer a copy service which allows you to copy trades on the eToro platform in two ways: 
(a) 
CopyTrader: where you can choose to copy the orders in an account of a single eToro trader. 
For more information, please refer to paragraph 8 - "Placing an order"; and 
(b) 
CopyPortfolio: where you can choose to copy an account which contains a portfolio of products 
and/or traders. Some portfolios are designed by us, and some are designed by third parties. 
Each portfolio will have certain profiles and parameters which may be set either manually or by 
using certain algorithms.  
More information about our copy trading functionality is available on our website. 
2.2 
We may update or amend the structure and/or composition of a strategy under the CopyPortfolio 
functionality at our discretion, without notifying you. This is called "re-balancing".  
3. 
Classification of trade 
3.1 
The copy trade service may result in trades in a number of financial instruments. Each trade opened 
on your behalf as part as the CopyTrader or CopyPortfolio functionalities will usually be classified under 
the same asset class as classified in the copied account.  
3.2 
If you are restricted from trading a certain asset class or specific product due to Applicable Law, other 
regulatory requirements or any other reason at eToro’s sole discretion, then we may take reasonable 
steps, where permitted by Applicable Law and where our service enables this at our sole discretion, to 
ensure that an equivalent or similar trade is opened in your account to replace the restricted trade (for 
example, replacing a CFD trade with a trade in the underlying product or vice versa). If we replace a 
trade for you, we cannot guarantee that the risk rating and economic performance of the replacement 
trade will match that of the restricted trade. Where in our sole discretion we do not replace a trade 
with an equivalent or similar trade for any reason your economic performance, portfolio composition, 
risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio may deviate from that of the eToro trader or 
CopyPortfolio being copied. 
 
61 
 
3.3 
You should read the General Terms and Conditions and the Schedule which applies to the underlying 
instrument for more information. Schedule A applies to CFDs, Schedule B applies to securities, and 
Schedule C applies to cryptoassets. 
4. 
Regulatory status of the copy trading service and suitability assessment 
4.1 
Our copy trading functionality may amount to a form of discretionary investment management. This 
means that, before you can engage in copy trading, we are required by law to assess whether copy 
trading is a suitable investment tool for you and under what conditions (the "Suitability Assessment"). 
The result of the Suitability Assessment is determined by information and documents provided to us 
by you, which you can update at any time.  
4.2 
We will establish your investment profile on the basis of your Suitability Assessment, and your ability 
to enter into copy trades may be limited by your Suitability Assessment. If we determine that copy 
trading is not a suitable investment tool for you, then you will not be permitted to access the copy 
trading functionalities of the eToro platform. We are not liable for any losses that you suffer as a result 
of providing false or misleading information as part of your Suitability Assessment, including where this 
leads to us creating an inaccurate investment profile for you. 
4.3 
Please also refer to clause 3 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the way in 
which we assess suitability. 
5. 
Limitations to our copy trading service 
5.1 
We do not provide personalised investment recommendations, investment advice, tax related advice 
or other financial related advice of any kind. Any explanation or information which we give to you as 
part of a copy trade, or about the performance of the copy trade is not intended to be, and should not 
be considered as advice. This information is provided by us solely for informational purposes.  
5.2 
You should use any information gathered from our website or social trading features as a starting point 
for your own independent research and investment decision making. However, you should not make 
investment decisions based on information provided on the eToro platform or eToro Community. 
5.3 
We will take reasonable steps to monitor the performance of any copied trader under the CopyTrader 
functionality, as well as the performance of the different trading strategies and portfolios under the 
CopyPortfolio functionality. We reserve the right to pause, stop, or block: 
(a) 
any eToro trader from being copied under the CopyTrader functionality; and 
(b) 
any portfolio of trading strategy from being copied under the CopyPortfolio functionality.  
6. 
The key risks of copy trading 
6.1 
In making a decision to copy a specific trader or traders, strategy and/or portfolio, you should consider 
your financial situation, including your financial commitments. You should understand that copy trading 
is highly speculative and that you could sustain significant losses exceeding the amount used to copy 
a trader or traders as a result of the following:  
(a) 
it will involve automated trading execution whereby trades are opened and closed in your 
account without your manual intervention; 
(b) 
if you manually modify or close an order generated by the CopyTrader functionality, you 
may achieve a materially different result than the trader that you copied; 
(c) 
copied trades in amounts lower than the minimum trade will not be opened; 
(d) 
if you are copying all trades which are currently open, we will open your position at the best 
available price at the time of copying and not the price at the time which the trade being 
copied was originally opened; 
 
62 
 
(e) 
cash-out and withdrawals by the copied trader, strategy and/or portfolio when you are using 
the CopyTrader/CopyPortfolio functionality may also generate a materially different result 
than the trader that you copied as it may affect the copy trading proportions. This is due to 
a number of different factors including starting account balance, minimum trade size, the 
investor's account settings, differences in spread, interest and investment price at time of 
investment, and also the difference in fees that may be incurred; 
(f) 
following/copying the trading decisions of inexperienced and/or unprofessional traders;  
(g) 
following/copying traders whose ultimate purpose or intention, or financial status may differ 
from yours; and/or 
(h) 
following and/or copying traders who trade, or CopyPortfolios which include, products 
restricted as a result of Applicable Law in relation to your account and where a replacement 
equivalent trade cannot be executed may result in the economic performance, portfolio 
composition, risk rating and other factors relating to your portfolio deviating from the 
portfolio of the copied trader or the CopyPortfolio. 
6.2 
We are unable to provide any guarantee as to the performance of any particular investment, account, 
portfolio or strategy. Please refer to the Schedule which applies to the underlying product that you are 
copying for more information on the risks associated with trading that product. 
6.3 
Past performance, risk scores, statistics and any other information with respect to eToro traders under 
our CopyTrader and/or CopyPortfolio functionality, or of different portfolios and trading strategies under 
our CopyPortfolio functionality are not reliable indicators of future performance. We do not represent 
or guarantee that you will achieve profits or losses similar to those shown on the eToro trader or 
portfolio that you are copying. We also do not represent or guarantee that the risk score of a trader 
will accurately reflect the risk of their future performances.  
6.4 
Please refer to clause 5 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the key risks of 
using our services. 
7. 
Conflicts of interest 
7.1 
We are required to act in your best interest when providing our services. However, there may be 
instances where your interest conflicts with our interests, or with another client's interest. For example, 
with respect to copy trading, we may compensate popular eToro traders who you and/or others have 
elected to follow and/or copy. 
7.2 
Please refer to clause 7 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on the conflicts of 
interest that may apply to our services. 
8. 
Placing an order 
8.1 
Before you enter into the copy trade, you will need to allocate the amount of money you would like to 
put towards that copy trade. Such amount shall be allocated in transactions at the same proportion as 
it is allocated in the copied account. We will then automatically execute that order for you, which means 
we will not obtain your confirmation before we do this. The opening of such transactions shall not 
require any prior consultation, consent or approval. Trades below the minimum trade amount shall not 
be opened. 
8.2 
There are a number of order restrictions when copy trading, including on the minimum and maximum 
amount that can be invested in any eToro trader or portfolio that you copy, the minimum amount on 
any single copy trade, and the maximum number of traders that you can copy. The full restrictions are 
listed on our website. 
8.3 
When you are using our CopyTrader service, you can choose to copy: 
(a) 
all trades which are currently open in a certain account as well as new trades which are opened 
after you begin to copy the trader in such account; or 
(b) 
only new trades which are opened after you begin to copy the trader's account. This means 
that we will not copy any trades in the trader's account which were entered into before this 
point. 
 
63 
 
8.4 
When you are using our CopyPortfolio service, the copy trading functionality only permits you to copy 
both existing and new trades. 
8.5 
Notwithstanding paragraph 3.2, if you are copying all trades which are currently open, we will open 
your position at the best available price at the time of copying and not the price at the time which the 
trade being copied was originally opened. If the relevant markets are closed at the time of copying (for 
example during a market break) we will open a market order for you and once the market reopens, 
your order will be executed at the first available price. 
8.6 
Notwithstanding paragraph 3.2, if you are copying only new trades:  
(a) 
we will open your positions at the same time as the trades being copied; and 
(b) 
all instructions and actions related to the copied trade will automatically be replicated in your 
eToro account (subject to the trade size as explained above), including stop losses, take profits 
and the closing of trades. For example, if a trader that you are copying extends their stop loss 
by adding more funds to their account then your stop loss will be adjusted automatically to 
reflect this. However, your position amount will remain the same as its initial amount. 
8.7 
The copy trading service has a number of other functionalities that we may make available to you from 
time to time. However, we may add, remove, or change the availability and features of these 
functionalities, at our discretion. This may impact how you can use the copy trading service on our 
platform, for example whether you can copy all trades or only new trades of a trader or a portfolio. 
9. 
Fees and costs 
9.1 
When you place a copy trade, we will charge you fees on the same basis as those charged to the copied 
account for the same trades. Please refer to the Schedule which applies to the underlying product that 
you are copying for more information on the fees and costs associated with that copy trade. 
9.2 
Please also refer to clause 21 of the General Terms and Conditions for more information on our fees 
and costs.  
10. 
Our rights and your rights in special circumstances 
Please refer to the Schedule which applies to the underlying product that you are copying for more 
information on our rights and your rights in special circumstances, as well as Part 3 of the General 
Terms and Conditions. 
11. 
Liability 
Subject to Applicable Law, neither eToro Europe nor any affiliates or associate third parties will be liable 
for any losses arising from: 
(a) 
actions taken by us in order to carry out your written or spoken instructions; 
(b) 
decisions or actions taken by an eToro trader that you have chosen to copy, including in 
connection with Portfolios; and/or 
(c) 
specific investment decisions or actions taken or omitted in good faith by any copied account 
strategy or portfolio, including portfolios controlled by us.
